131326,"The patient was immediately taken to the operating room (OR) for damage control by the orthopedic team and required invasive rewarming by cardiopulmonary bypass through cannulation of the femoral artery/vein. Plastic surgery was consulted to manage the extensive soft tissue wounds. There was insufficient local soft tissue for coverage of the left below-knee amputation stump, preventing tension-free closure (). Soft tissue reconstruction was necessary to preserve stump length and provide stable and durable padding for prosthesis.The amputated parts were examined for potential spare parts harvesting. The left amputated lower limb was severely crushed and did not contain viable soft tissue. The right amputated lower limb (above-knee amputation) was crushed at the proximal portion but the distal soft tissue was spared (). A sole fillet flap () and a split-thickness skin grafts were therefore harvested from the right amputated lower extremity. However, as the patient was hemodynamically unstable, microsurgery was delayed and the spare parts were preserved for later use. The flap was flushed with UW solution for approximately 20 min until all the blood was removed. The flap was subsequently wrapped in sterile saline gauze and placed in a sterile plastic bag at 4°C for later use. In addition, the posterior tibial artery (pedicle of the sole fillet flap) was cannulated and flushed with heparinized saline and UW solution every 12 h. The skin graft was also preserved in a UW solution at 4°C.The patient’s condition gradually improved during the following 48 h and she was taken back to the OR for further debridement of devitalized muscle and definitive soft tissue coverage. She eventually became hemodynamically stable and rewarming by cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued. It was only after hypovolemic shock resolution and extubation that reconstruction was considered. The flap was irrigated with a heparinized saline solution and anastomosed to the posterior tibial artery and posterior tibial vein. The donor tibial nerve was anastomosed to the recipient tibial nerve for sensory innervation. The flap was well vascularized intra-operatively with good arterial flow and venous return (). The time between thawing and reperfusion was approximately 2 h. Doppler revealed triphasic arterial signal and capillary refill was less than 2 s. The flap was inset to cover the stump and the remaining non-weight bearing raw areas were skin grafted using the preserved split-thickness skin grafts. The flap remained viable post-operatively with no concerns for 5 days. However, on the fifth post-operative day, the patient became febrile with a rising white blood cell count. Purulent fluid was noted beneath the flap and the patient was taken back to the OR. Exploration demonstrated a viable flap and necrotic hamstring muscles. Further debridement and drainage was performed. Antibiotics were also administered. On the seventh post-operative day, a hemorrhagic blister was noted over a pale and cool flap, a finding suspicious of flap ischemia. Operative re-exploration revealed a thrombosis of the arterial anastomosis. The venous anastomosis was not thrombosed. Salvage attempts were futile. Discussions with the patient’s family members resulted in their desire to defer any addition free flap options and expedite coverage with a skin graft. The family’s wishes were respected and the debrided flap was replaced with a skin graft.",gcs,8,nan
