Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She reported no previous history of cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking. On admission to the hospital, her right upper limb hemiparesis resolved rapidly and completely. The results of laboratory examinations, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte levels, and coagulation studies, were within normal limits, except for slight hypertriglyceridemia. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, and a brain computed tomography scan appeared normal. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed no definite evidence of acute infarction. Neither significant steno-occlusive lesions nor cerebral aneurysms in the intra/extracranial vessels were demonstrated by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a well-defined echogenic mass in the LA with a broad-based attachment to the interatrial septum (). The LA was not enlarged, and left ventricular (LV) systolic function was normal, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the presence of a heterogeneous mobile mass (33\u00d725 mm) with internal echo-free spaces, and color Doppler flow mapping showed flow signal within the mass suggesting hypervascularity (). The mass did not involve the heart valves directly, and Doppler echocardiography revealed no impairment of flow across the mitral valve. The diagnosis of an embolic transient ischemic attack (TIA) caused by a LA myxoma was made.",

She did not consume alcohol or non-prescription drugs between discharge and readmission. She reported compliance with prescribed medications at home.\\nDuring the preceding hospitalization, the patient presented with altered mental status, fever, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, and a white blood cell count of 14.1 thousand/\u03bcL. Altered mental status was gauged by the West Haven Criteria, by which the patient had grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy. Her discriminant function was 99. Hepatic dysfunction was characterized by albumin of 3.0 g/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.36, ammonia of 300 mcg/dL, and bilirubin of 30.3 mg/dL. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 241 IU/L and 62 IU/L, respectively. Body mass index was 16.5. Clinical and radiographic features were suggestive of chronic liver disease, including encephalopathy, ascites, asterixis, spider angiomata and esophageal varices without active gastrointestinal bleeding. Liver biopsy and histology were not obtained as the results would not affect management. Her serum ascites albumin gradient was 3.8 gm/dL and confirmed portal hypertension. Despite appropriate therapy with lactulose and rifaximin, the patient remained grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed. Although it was a limited study due to patient movement, bilateral temporal parietal restriction was described, raising concern for PRES. There was no evidence of seizure activity on 60-min electroencephalography (EEG) at the time. Despite mild intermittent headaches, she remained stable without focal neurologic deficits, and was discharged home on the recommended steroid taper for alcoholic hepatitis, ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis, fluconazole for candidal esophagitis found on upper endoscopy, nadolol for grade 1 esophageal nonbleeding varices, lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and spironolactone and furosemide for ascites.\\nThe patient was readmitted in less than 24 h following a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. She was intubated for airway protection and rapidly extubated within 24 h. Her admission vital signs included a temperature of 97.2 F, pulse of 95 beats/min, respiratory rate of 8 breaths/min and a blood pressure of 114/78 mmHg. Off sedation, there were no focal neurologic findings. Labs were significant for hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, INR of 1.79, prothrombin time of 19.4 s, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 15.5 mmol/L, total bilirubin of 10.8 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 6.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 133 IU/L, ALT of 54 IU/L, and AST of 112 IU/L, all relatively unchanged from her discharge labs.",

        "note": "A 51-year-old male was admitted to the local hospital after a hump-nosed viper bite on his hand while weeding his garden. Since the viper was brought alive by the neighbors, primary care physician was able to make a positive identification of the snake as Merrem's hump-nosed viper (Hypnale hypnale). The patient had severe pain and swelling in the hand. The next day his urine output was reduced and he was transferred to a tertiary care institute for hemodialysis. On admission, patient was conscious and rational, febrile, and he was in pain. He was pale and mildly icteric. He had marked swelling and redness in his right hand with blistering at the bite site.\\nHis pulse rate was 92 beats per minute and blood pressure was 118/78 mmHg. On auscultation of the heart, S1 and S2 were heard in normal intensity with no murmurs. Respiratory system examination was normal except for few fine basal crepitations. Abdominal examination was normal with no organ enlargement or free fluid. Neurological examination was normal with no ophthalmoplegia or other cranial nerve paralysis.\\nHis investigation results were as follows: white cell count, 12,700 (80% neutrophils); platelet count, 40,000/\u03bcl; hemoglobin, 9.9 g/dl; International normalized ratio, 1.46; activated partial thromboplastin time, 43 s; serum creatinine, 1,040 \u03bcmol/l; Na, +130 mmol/l; K+, 5.4 mmol/l; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 10 mm/Hr; C-reactive protein, 1 mg/L; aspartate transaminase, 54 u/l; alanine transaminase, 42 u/l; serum bilirubin, 22.7 \u03bcmol/l; total protein, 52 g/l (albumin 33 g/l). Peripheral blood smear revealed marked red cell fragmentation, polychromasia and reduced number of platelets indicating disseminated intravascular coagulation. Serum calcium, 7.7 mg/dl; serum phosphate, 3.1 mg/dl; creatine phosphokinase, 122 u/l; urine microscopy showing 10-12 pus cells and 1-2 red cells per high power field with no casts. Protein was present in urine in trace amounts. Abdominal ultrasound scan revealed enlarged and globular kidneys suggestive of acute renal parenchymal disease. Venom-induced acute tubular necrosis was suspected.\\nHe was commenced on hemodialysis. After 12 sessions of hemodialysis, he was dialysis dependent and renal biopsy was performed 8 weeks after the viper bite. The biopsy revealed patchy areas of tubular atrophy with interstitial edema and patchy interstitial chronic inflammation suggesting subacute interstitial nephritis. There was no evidence of acute tubular necrosis possibly because biopsy was performed very late after the onset of AKI. Glomeruli were normal.\\nTen weeks after the viper bite, the patient's renal functions and urine output were improved. He was discharged from the hospital to be reviewed in clinic as an outpatient. At the time of discharge, he had a serum creatinine of 1.9 mg/dl and serum potassium of 3.9 mmol/l.\\nEighteen weeks after the initial viper bite, he was admitted with sudden onset bilateral lower limb weakness. There was no respiratory muscle paralysis. Both lower limbs had grade two muscle power and upper limbs grade four. Reflexes were diminished and Babinski sign was negative. There was no objective sensory loss.\\nDuring this admission, he was found to have acidotic breathing. Arterial pH was 7.31 and PCO2 18 mmHg, PO2 121 mmHg, and HCO3\\n\u2212 10.3 mmol/l. His serum potassium level was 7.0 mmol/l with sodium 130 mmol/l and chloride 114 mmol/l. ECG showed tall tented T waves suggestive of hyperkalemia. Serum creatinine was 114 \u03bcmol/l with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 76 ml/min. He was given intravenous calcium gluconate, nebulized with salbutamol and started on insulin-dextrose infusion until an urgent hemodialysis was arranged.

He presented with complaints of swelling of the face and neck and multiple episodes of vomiting associated with traces of blood. On presentation, the patient had no complaints of shortness of breath, dizziness, muscle aches, or a decrease in urine output. On initial evaluation, the patient was found to be conscious and oriented to time, place, and person. Glasgow coma scale was 15/15. His pulse rate was 82 beats per minute, blood pressure was 110/80 mm of Hg, respiratory rate was 14 per minute and he was afebrile. Systemic examination, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular was unremarkable. On local examination of the oral cavity, the oral mucosa was found to be edematous and had multiple ulcers extending up to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tongue was ulcerated and coated. Diffuse neck swelling was present whereas laryngeal crepitus was absent and contour was normal. Initial management upon presentation included insertion of two wide-bore intravenous cannulas, urinary catheter, and infusion of intravenous fluids. A nasogastric tube was not inserted because of suspected upper gastrointestinal injury, marked by the presence of hematemesis. Intravenous infusions of N- N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and pantoprazole were commenced and continued for 48 hours. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole were also initiated. The laboratory findings made during the patient's hospitalization are listed in Table . Mild transaminitis was noted initially, which subsequently normalized by the second day, in striking contrast to renal function parameters, which deteriorated significantly over the course of his illness. Radiological investigations performed initially, including chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable. Over the next two days, there was a deterioration of the patient\u2019s condition, heralded by breathlessness and tachypnea. The patient developed profound respiratory difficulty and was unable to maintain normal oxygen saturation. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit in view of impending type 1 respiratory failure where he was intubated and managed with mechanical ventilation.\\nA non-contrast CT (NCCT) scan of the chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities with a tree-in-bud appearance, suggesting the possibility of chemical pneumonitis (Figure ). Both NCCT and ultrasound of the neck were unremarkable. Ophthalmological assessment of the fundus was unremarkable and no evidence of papillitis was seen. The subsequent fall in the urine output and the lab investigations depicting a worsening renal function profile raised the suspicion of rhabdomyolysis as the underlying culprit. The muscle enzymes (creatine phosphokinase, muscle, and lactate dehydrogenase) were found to be highly elevated and urine analysis was positive for myoglobin. The patient was subjected to hemodialysis sessions every alternate day in view of worsening renal function and high anion gap metabolic acidosis.",

To counteract the cholinergic\\nsyndrome, a bolus of 1mg of atropine was administered i.v., followed by additional\\nboluses every 5 minutes until the patient's condition was stabilized. A total amount\\nof 37mg of atropine was used to achieve a reduction of secretions and respiratory\\ndistress. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with prolongation of the\\ncorrected QT interval (520ms). A few hours later, the patient had a dramatic\\ndecrease in carbon dioxide removal, attaining a partial arterial pressure of carbon\\ndioxide of 57mmHg and a blood pH of 7.08, which suggested acute respiratory\\nacidosis. At this moment, the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) activity in red\\nblood cells was 2.44% (0.0219 \u2206pH/hour). The prolonged altered mental status plus an\\noxygen partial pressure (PaO2) < 60mmHg prompted the admission of the\\npatient into the intensive care unit (ICU), where he was intubated. Midazolam and\\nfentanyl were intravenously administered during the first 24 hours as sedatives.",

After an unknown time, he was found in an unconscious state by a relative, who called for medical aid. It was estimated that at least one hour elapsed before our patient received medical care.\\nOn arrival to our emergency department, our patient had a gasping breath without foreign bodies in his oronasal cavities, palpable regular pulses with a rate of 130 beats per minute and an arterial pressure of 80/40mmHg. On pulse oxymetry he had a saturation of 80% on room air. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 8 (absent eye opening, unintelligible voice responses and limp withdrawal to painful stimuli), his papillae were isochoric and light reflexes were bilaterally present. Because of his altered consciousness and impending respiratory failure, our patient was urgently intubated and put under controlled mechanical ventilation.\\nThe rest of the physical examination revealed that his face, the front part of his neck and the upper part of his chest were congested, edematous and covered with numerous petechiae, especially on the conjunctivae and the periorbital skin. In a later bedside ophthalmologic examination, mild bilateral periorbital swelling, severe bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhages, chemosis, mild exophthalmos and mild optic disc edema were observed. Ecchymotic bruises were also noted on the back part of his neck and the upper part of both shoulders. His tympanic membranes were clear and there were no mucosal hemorrhages of his upper airways.\\nAbsence of breathing sounds over both lung apices in combination with palpable subcutaneous emphysema over his neck pointed towards the existence of bilateral pneumothorax. Moreover, bloody fluid was drained through the endotracheal tube, indicating possible lung contusions. The physical examination of his heart and abdomen was unremarkable and electrocardiogram was normal. Thoracic X-ray examination revealed bilateral pneumothorax and multiple rib fractures (Figure ). In this respect, bilateral tube thoracostomies were inserted, draining air and blood and eliciting major improvement in his hemodynamic parameters. In subsequent X-rays, bilateral lung opacities were evident, which were consistent with the clinical suspicion of lung contusions. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was not performed due to the bilateral pneumothorax. Subsequently, our patient was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU). Arterial blood gases on admission to our ICU were: pH 7.246; partial pressure of carbon dioxide: 58.3mmHg; partial pressure of oxygen: 441mmHg; bicarbonate: 21.9mEq/L; oxygen saturation: 99.9%; and lactate: 1.1mmol/L while our patient was ventilated with a frequency of 15 breaths/min; tidal volume: 700mL; positive end-expiratory pressure: 5cmH2O; and fraction of inspired oxygen: 100%.",

He complained of fatigue, bad appetite, dark urine, and yellowish sclerae for 1 month. He neither had fever nor any other disease history, including hereditary or familial clustered infectious diseases.\\nPhysical examination at admission showed the following: height 170 cm, weight 86 kg, temperature 36.5\u00b0C, blood pressure (BP) 104/68 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80 beats/min, oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) under room air 98%, clear consciousness, dull face, palpebral conjunctival pallor, moderate scleral icterus, normal breath sounds in both chest regions, normal heart sounds, mild liver and spleen enlargement, abdominal distension with shifting dullness, and liver palms (palmar erythema). Laboratory studies revealed progressive thrombocytopenia, anemia with elevated reticulocytes (Ret), and liver damage compared with those at local hospitals (). Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 432 mg/dl (normal reference range (NR), 71\u2013231 mg/dl), and serum ferritin was 1,992 (NR, 10\u2013260 ng/ml). The urine bilirubin was positive. Meanwhile, laboratory studies also showed that the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), beta-1,3-glucan, and galactomannan were all within the reference range (NR), with slightly elevated levels of procalcitonin (PCT) and interleukin (IL)-6 (). The serum levels of vitamins B12, folate, and iron (iron, ferritin, transferrin, and transferrin saturation) were all within NR. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was negative. The serum markers of liver cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, thalassemia and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene test, thyroid function test, laboratory tests of autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid, type A to E hepatitis, HIV, syphilis, the DNA and IgM of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), and the DNA and IgM of cytomegalovirus (CMV) were all negative. Chest CT examination showed no obvious abnormalities (). Abdominal color Doppler ultrasound revealed fatty liver, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), dilated portal vein, hepatosplenomegaly, and ascites (), which were consistent with the enhanced abdominal CT report performed 4 weeks earlier at the local hospital (without details). Cultures of ascites were negative, and ascite routine examination found 240 white blood cells (WBC) (). Bone marrow smears suggested HA without AAC or HPS (). Based on the above, he was diagnosed with AH, acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), chronic cholecystitis, and HA. Under empirical antibiotics (cefoperazone/sulbactam) and supportive drug treatments, his transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased; however, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal blood coagulation worsened (). On the 10th day of admission, he received a transfusion of 2 units of washed RBC for Hb<60 g/L ().\\nOn the 14th day of admission, the patient suddenly had a high fever of 39.6\u00b0C and blue\u2013purple ecchymosis on his proximal right upper limb (without picture). From this day to the 25th day of admission, he received meropenem instead of cefoperazone/sulbactam sodium as an empirical antibacterial treatment, and his highest body temperature dropped from 39.6\u00b0C to 38.2\u00b0C after 2 days, and then his fever was maintained at a low level (). During this period, laboratory tests showed that routine blood tests of WBC was within NR ( and ), and serum levels of CRP, PCT, beta-1,3-glucan, and galactomannan did not change much compared with those of before, and the serum IL-6 level was slightly higher (). The WBC count in ascites was lower, with a higher proportion of granulocytes. Blood tests for influenza A and B, CMV, EBV, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, mycoplasma, chlamydia, and 2019-nCoV were all negative. Cultures and mass spectrometry of urine, ascites, and blood were all negative. However, during this period, in the case of blood transfusion, Hb showed a significant reduction with increasing Ret (), Platelet (PLT) was still maintained at a significantly low level, and the bilirubin gradually increased, and prothrombin activity (PTA) and concentration of fibrinogen (FIB) gradually decreased ( and ). Arteriovenous color Doppler ultrasound of both upper limbs showed no abnormalities.\\nAt midnight on the 26th day of admission, the patient\u2019s temperature suddenly reached 40.7\u00b0C (), and the blue\u2013purple ecchymosis on his proximal right upper limb enlarged (), however, Blue-purple ecchymosis did not appear on his trunk, lower limbs and upper left limb (including the catheterization sites of arteries and veins, ). Simultaneously, he had shortness of breath, dyspnea, and cough without expectoration. His SpO2 decreased to 88%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 91.9 mmHg and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32.6 mmHg under low-flow nasal cannula therapy. Blood laboratory tests found that WBC, CRP, PCT, and galactomannan did not change much, and LDH and ferritin increased to 3,038 mg/dl and 1123 ng/ml, respectively. Serum IL-6 and beta-1,3-glucan were much higher than before, and the Ret% decreased from the original abnormally increased level to within NR (). Chest CT showed a few scattered vague exudates and small nodules (). He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were 14 and 16, respectively. For suspected viral or fungal infections, voriconazole was added as antifungal therapy, and a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was given to relieve his shortness of breath and dyspnea. Blood transfusion-related infectious diseases including B19 infection was suspected by reviewing his medical history. A blood sample was collected for detection of B19 IgM and IgG and culture and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of pathogens on the second day (8 h after being transferred to the MICU). The next day, the NGS results reported extremely high DNA copies of B19 (1,605,726 copies/\u00b5g DNA, and the relative abundance was 99.99%) ().\\nIn order to clarify the diagnosis of AAC (continuously decreasing RBC count and acute significant reduction of Ret count) and HPS (fever lasting 2 weeks, splenomegaly, increased ferritin, decreased FIB, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), on the second day in MICU, we performed a bone marrow smear and pathological biopsy on the patient. The results indicated the diagnosis of AAC with HPS (). Meanwhile, the blood smear showed a late stage and thereafter neutrophils, with the increasing neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score, indicating the possibility of infection (without picture). Bone marrow biopsy immunohistochemistry and special staining showed that the islands of young RBCs were not easy to see, hemophagocytic cells containing RBCs were visible, and no tumor-related bone marrow manifestations were observed, indicating the possibility of AAC with HPS (without picture). Therefore, methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) and IVIG (0.4 g/kg) were prescribed.\\nOn the third day in the MICU, the patient experienced significantly worsening shortness of breath with profuse sweating, HR of 130 beats/min, respiratory rate of 35 breaths/min, SpO2 of 86%, BP of 120/76 mmHg, urine output of 230 ml/h, and many wet rales in the lungs. Bedside chest radiograph showed \u201cconsolidations, bilateral involvement, peripheral distribution, lower zone dominance and reduction in lung volume\u201d (). Bedside B-ultrasound showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 65%. The myocardial enzyme spectrum was within NR, and ABG revealed PaO2 of 51 mmHg, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 83%, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-aDO2) of 546, and lactic acid (Lac) of 8.7 mmol/L. The APACHE-II and SOFA scores increased to 32 and 28, respectively. Severe pneumonia and ARDS were newly diagnosed, and endotracheal intubation for invasive mechanical treatment was performed. Infection by B19 mixed with other pathogens in his lung was suspected. Smears, culture, and NGS of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed. His oxygenation did not improve under very high parameters of invasive mechanical ventilation (synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV): Vt 5 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 15 cmH2O, Ps 16 cmH2O, and FiO2 90%), so prone ventilation was administered after adequate analgesia, sedation, and muscle relaxation. After 12 h of prone ventilation, his oxygenation improved, and ventilatory parameters decreased gradually. ABG showed that the Lac reduced to a normal level of 1.7 mmol/L, oxygenation improved significantly, and ventilatory parameters were decreased to a lower level (SIMV: Vt 5 ml/kg, PEEP 8 cmH2O, Ps 12 cm cmH2O, and FiO2 60%).\\nOn the fourth day in the MICU, NGS of BALF reported B19 (15,938 copies/\u00b5g DNA, and the relative abundance was 97.85%) (), Candida albicans (5 copies/\u00b5g DNA, and the relative abundance was 4.55%), Rothia mucilaginosa (86,379 copies/\u00b5g DNA, and the relative abundance was 82.66%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2,727 copies/\u00b5g DNA, and the relative abundance was 11.42%), and Streptococcus mitis (1,657 copies/\u00b5g DNA, and the relative abundance was 99.99%). Cultures of blood and BALF reported negative results. During the next three days, the patient\u2019s condition improved to some extent, ventilatory parameters were further decreased to a lower level (SIMV: Vt 5 ml/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O, Ps 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 44%), and ABG showed good ventilation and oxygenation of the lungs (PaO2 141 mmHg, SaO2% 99.9%, PaCO2 36 mmHg, A-aDO2 113, and Lac 1.4 mmol/L). The previously increased transaminase, bilirubin, IL-6, and beta-1,3-glucan levels gradually decreased, but Hb, PLT, Ret count, and Ret% were still at very low levels ().",

He and his wife denied recent trips outside the city. Zoonosis was absent. He was not physically active and did not have an adequate diet. Pathological antecedents revealed liver cirrhosis, diagnosed 12 years ago, alongside esophageal varices that had been treated with sclerotherapy 7 years prior. He also had a diagnosis of essential hypertension, diagnosed 20 years ago. His treatment prior to hospitalization included 20 mg of propranolol every 12 hours, which was used to treat his essential hypertension, esophageal varices, and to reduce his portal hypertension.\\nHe arrived at our institution \u201cIMSS General Hospital Zone 1, Colima\u201d in the early afternoon (day 1, see Table ). He began to experience extreme pain localized in his right foot, 16 to 18 hours prior to admission, with a local pain scale of 10/10. He denied any recent forms of punctures to the overlying skin (including animal and insect bites).\\nOn physical examination during admission, he was somnolent, oriented in person and space, but not oriented to time. His vital signs were: arterial pressure (AP, systolic/diastolic) 67/49, mean AP (MAP) 55, heart rate (HR) 88, respiratory rate (RR) 16, and body temperature 36 \u00b0C. He presented hepatopathy facies and spontaneous eyelid opening, his oral mucosa was dry, and his neck showed jugular engorgement grade I. Both hemithorax were slightly hypoventilated with no adventitious sounds. Precordial was rhythmic with low intensity sounds and no murmurs were heard. Peristalsis was present in his abdomen but low in intensity and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. His upper extremities were symmetrical, eutrophic, with no signs of edema; he moved his upper extremities freely without any limitation, no asterixis was present, and a force scale of 4/5 was seen. During exploration of inferior extremities, there was a clear asymmetric pattern. His right lower extremity was volume augmented with signs of edema ++ including large and small bullae formation with serohematogenous liquid inside involving most of his right foot and ankle (Fig. ). The pedal pulse was present but weak and had a local elevated temperature on palpation. His movements were markedly limited due to extreme pain. Deep vein thrombosis maneuvers were performed and were not present. Plantar reflexes were also not seen.\\nA peripheral intravenously administered high-dose double scheme of antibiotics (clindamycin plus ceftriaxone), crystalloid fluids, and corticosteroids was initiated. Laboratory studies were performed soon after admission: hemoglobin (Hb) 12.6 g/dl, hematocrit (Htc) 40.3%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 103.9 fL, white blood cells (WBC) 39,400/mm3, neutrophils 37,460/mm3, platelets 104,000/mm3, thrombin time (TT) 26.7 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.15, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 42.8 seconds, glucose 61 g/dL, urea 102.72 mg/dL, creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TB) 3.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin (DB) 2.6 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 1.5 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 58 U/L, P 7.1 mEq/L, Ca 8.4 mEq/L, Cl 106 mEq/L, K 6.4 mEq/L, Na 129 mEq/L, Mg 1.72 mEq/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 420 U/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.07 mg/L. Correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance was initiated. Deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by clinical assessment and Doppler ultrasound. Aspiration of bulla liquid was obtained and sent to a laboratory for cultivation (positive to Cedecea lapagei, results returned on day 2). Interdisciplinary consultation with angiology was carried out (no indications were added).

Half an hour after the poisoning, he was found foaming at the mouth, delirious, and cold to the touch, but he had no physical tics or incontinence. He was admitted to a local hospital 1 hour after the poisoning, where he recovered consciousness. Approximately 2 hours after the poisoning, he was transferred to the intensive care unit of a local traditional Chinese medicine hospital. Upon admission, he felt dizziness, chest tightness, chills, and shortness of breath. His blood pressure could not be measured, and laboratory examinations revealed dysfunction of the heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, and blood coagulation. Computed tomography of the brain showed normal findings, but computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the pulmonary arteries suggested multiple embolisms in the bilateral pulmonary arteries, upper and lower pulmonary artery trunk, and various blood vessel branches (). Computed tomography of the chest showed the same results as pulmonary CTA, and computed tomography of the abdomen suggested thrombosis in the inferior vena cava near the liver (). Cardiac echocardiography indicated an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild hypertension in the pulmonary artery. Bilateral lower extremity arteriovenous color Doppler imaging showed no obvious abnormalities.\\nAfter these examinations, the patient\u2019s vital signs again became unstable. He was immediately intubated and mechanically ventilated and sent to the emergency department for urokinase therapy (600,000 IU) together with norepinephrine to maintain his blood pressure. CTA after thrombolysis showed improvement in the right lower pulmonary artery branches, but not in the right pulmonary artery trunk (). The patient\u2019s hemodynamics remained unstable, suggesting ineffective thrombolysis. At 18 hours after poisoning, he was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit of our hospital.

        "note": "A 63-year-old man who had undergone CAPD for 11 years was admitted to the emergency room due to general weakness, fever, and abdominal pain with hazy dialysate. He was an East Asian male, an office worker, who was 1 meter and 70 centimeters tall weighing 67.0 kg. His CAPD regimen consisted of a, 4 times a day, conventional 1.5% glucose anhydrous based dialysis solution containing lactate. The patient had been anuric for several years. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents nor intravenous iron replacement had not been prescribed during the last month. However, he had been constantly receiving oral iron replacement. Two days before admission, he ate a sliced raw skate (thornback ray), and abdominal pain and diarrhea developed on the next day. The underlying cause of his end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was chronic glomerulonephritis, and there was no history of liver disease, diabetes mellitus, or steroid use. On admission, his body temperature was 39.5 \u00b0C, blood pressure 116/62 mmHg, and pulse rate 99 beats/min. There was direct and rebound tenderness on the whole abdomen. No definite skin lesions were discovered on any part of his body at initial evaluation, and the exit site of the peritoneal dialysis catheter was clean. Serum laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count 1930/\u03bcL, hemoglobin level 8.0 g/dL, aspartate/alanine transaminase levels 37/72 IU/L, serum iron level 36.0 \u03bcg/dL, transferrin saturation 22.0%, ferritin level 745.6 \u03bcg/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) level 109 mg/L, and procalcitonin level 65.89 ng/mL. Peritoneal fluid analysis revealed that WBC count was 3400/\u03bcL with 80.1% of PMN cells. The laboratory results are summarized in Table . Peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid cultures were performed, and the patient was empirically treated with initial loading doses of intraperitoneal cefazolin 1000 mg and tobramycin 60 mg followed by maintenance doses of cefazolin 250 mg per each PD (peritoneal dialysis) and tobramycin 30 mg once a day. On the hospital day 2, his body temperature remained elevated at 38.3 \u00b0C, and his blood pressure decreased to 78/60 mmHg. The follow-up laboratory test results showed that plasma sodium level was 130 mmol/L, potassium level 6.2 mmol/L, chloride level 91 mmol/L, bicarbonate level 14.4 mmol/L, and arterial blood pH 7.351. In addition, multiple vesicles with annular erythema and peripheral edema appeared on both lower extremities. Even after appropriate fluid supplementation, the patient remained in persistent shock, and the inotropic agent dose was increased to maintain the patient\u2019s blood pressure. The patient was consequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated. At the time of ICU admission, the patient\u2019s SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score was 12, and SAPS-II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II) score was 53.",

The reconstruction procedure consisted of hepaticojejunostomy, Braun\u2019s anastomosis, and gastrojejunostomy. In addition, a stent had been inserted for stenosis of the hepaticojejunostomy 1 month prior. The patient\u2019s medical history also included atrial fibrillation, and he was taking insulin and apixaban. On arrival, he appeared to be pale and his extremities were cold. His vital signs were as follows: respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; pulse rate, 105 beats/min (bpm); blood pressure, 77/54 mmHg; temperature, 34.9 \u00b0C. Arterial blood gas analysis detected severe lactic acidosis (lactate concentration: 9.9 mmol/L) and anemia (hemoglobin level: 3.1 g/dL). The laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 5850/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein level of 0.08 mg/dL, procalcitonin level of 0.097 ng/mL, and serum glucose level of 389 mg/dL. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen did not detect any active bleeding. His melena had already ceased. Fluid resuscitation and massive transfusions resolved his hemorrhagic shock. Crystalloids were administered 800 mL over an hour. Blood products were initiated 30 min after the patient\u2019s arrival. The patient required 16 units of red blood cell concentrate, 14 units of fresh frozen plasma and 20 units of platelets within 12 h of his arrival for hemostatic resuscitation. A classification of hemorrhage of the patient was considered as class IV based on the American College of Surgeons. Urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was a poor study because of food residue and failed to identify the source of the patient\u2019s bleeding.

He had no family history of pancreatic or biliary disorders.\\nInduction treatment for transplantation consisted in Basiliximab, prednisone and mycophenolate mophetil (MMF); after surgery, he presented delayed graft function that required two consecutive dialytic sessions. Of note, at day 1 after transplant (while anuric) he had an asymptomatic elevation of pancreatic enzymes (peak of serum amylase: 718 U/l), that gradually resolved in 5 days. From day 8 he started receiving cyclosporine. The patient also received anti-CMV prophylaxis with Valaciclovir. The further course was unremarkable, and the patient was regularly discharged at day 14 with a serum creatinine of 2,1 mg/dl. However, 5 days after he presented at follow up visit with colic pain involving the upper right quadrant of the abdomen; an abdominal ultrasonography showed a normally distended gallbladder, with no dilatation of the common bile duct or biliary three; he had no frank elevation of pancreatic enzymes. The patient received a course of antibiotics for evidence of pneumonia at chest X-ray. On that day, he started Everolimus, (the patients was enrolled in a trial that addressed the possibility of minimizing calcineurin inhibitors nephrotoxicity with the use of mTOR inhibitors); the target through-levels for immunouppressors were 8 ng/dl for Everolimus and 300 ng/dl for Cyclosporine. After two more weeks the patients had an episode of diarrhea; MMF was withdrawn (following the study protocol), and Everolimus dose was increased to reach target levels (on that day, blood level was 5,11 ng/ml). The patient had mild elevation in pancreatic enzymes, asymptomatic, since the beginning of treatment with Everolimus (Fig. ). There was also evidence of mild rise in serum triglycerides (ranging from 240 to 330 mg/dl) with normal total and LDL cholesterol, for which appropriate dietary advice was preferred to lipid-lowering treatment, according to current guidelines []. On day 34 after KT, the patient presented to the emergency department with pain at the upper quadrants of the abdomen; he had marked elevation of pancreatic enzymes (serum amylase 1383 U/l, serum lipase 1015 U/l), no elevation in liver enzymes or bilirubin, mild leukocytosis (white blood cells count: 10,13 \u00d7 103/ul), no hypercalcemia (serum calcium 8,2 mg/dl), moderate elevation in triglycerides (400 mg/dl); RT-PCRs for Cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus were negative.",

        "note": "A 42-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency room at Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient reported that he was lying in bed watching television when he suddenly started feeling intense substernal chest pain. He described the pain as if someone was kicking him in the chest, rating the pain at 8/10 in severity. The pain was non-radiating, not reproducible, and without any alleviating or aggravating factors. It was associated with diaphoresis and one episode of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. The patient reported that he was smoking marijuana just one hour prior to the onset of the chest pain. His social history was significant for smoking marijuana six to seven times a day for the past 20 years, he was a social alcohol user, and denied any other illicit substance abuse, including cocaine.\\nInitial vital signs were within normal limits with blood pressure (BP) at 116/81 mmHg, an oral temperature of 36.2\u00b0C (97.2\u00b0F), a pulse of 61 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97%. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a significant ST depression in V3 and V4 which is shown in Figure .\\nInitial troponin was found to be mildly elevated at 0.044 ng/mL by laboratory standards but was clinically negative for myocardial infarction. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabinoids only. However, based on the EKG findings and symptomatology, the patient was treated as non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) team was activated. He was administered 325 mg of aspirin and 180 mg of ticagrelor and taken for PCI. He was found to have 100% stenosis (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow 0) of the first obtuse marginal (OM) artery and the right coronary artery. An EluNIR\u2122 (Cordis, Santa Clara, CA) 2.5 x 24 mm drug-eluting stent (ridaforolimus) was placed in the first OM as it was thought to be the culprit lesion causing the symptoms. Pre and post-PCI catheterization images are shown in Figure .\\nThe patient reported that his chest pain was relieved after the procedure. EKG showed complete resolution of the ST depressions after PCI. Troponin was measured again post-procedure and found to be 27.9 ng/mL where it peaked. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 61%. However, it did show akinesis of the mid-inferolateral walls and features consistent with a pseudonormal left ventricular filling pattern, concomitant abnormal relaxation, and increased filling pressure consistent with a Grade II diastolic dysfunction. Echocardiogram images displaying diastolic dysfunction are shown in Figure .\\nAdditional laboratory workup showed normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 110, and a hemoglobin A1C of 5.3%.",

        "note": "This is the case of a Colombian 50-year-old non-diabetic and obese female (BMI 31.5 Kg/m2) with a past medical history of severe HTG (onset after her menarche and worsening during pregnancies), arterial hypertension and one miscarriage. She attended the Emergency Department four years ago complaining of several episodes of vomiting, abdominal distension, and epigastric pain after a copious meal. There were no peritoneal irritation signs and laboratory results included high concentrations of lipase (2.691 U/L) and triglycerides (TG) (1.148 mg/dL). She was started on intravenous fluids, antispasmodics, and analgesics with complete resolution of symptoms and was therefore discharged.\\nThe patient was lost on follow-up and apparently replaced allopathic treatment for dyslipidemia (fibrate plus high-potency statin) with homeopathic medications. After three years, she complained again of abdominal epigastric pain irradiated to right lumbar quadrant. Basic blood tests were otherwise normal with the exception of high levels of transaminases (AST 427.1 U/L, ALT 374 U/L). Abdominal contrasted computed tomography and magnetic resonance showed inflammation of the pancreatic head, neck and uncinated process with plastron and signs of portal hypertension (). Based on normal serum lipase (43 U/L), these findings were considered as incidental non-acute pancreatitis and treatment was disregarded; on the contrary, a diagnosis of toxic hepatitis caused by homeopathic drugs was suggested.\\nOne month later, nausea, abdominal pain, and distension recurred on epigastrium and right hypochondrium. Laboratories obtained were positive for HTG (2.066 mg/dL) with elevated lipase (982 U/L) in the settings of acute pancreatitis (APACHE II score: 8). Suddenly, she exhibited an altered state of consciousness and hypotension (MBP 40 mmHg) and was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit for four days. Considering that the clinical picture was consistent with a very-severe hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis and that worrisome characteristics were present, the gastroenterology team started her on unfractionated heparin infusion for 3 days (5000 UI/5 hrs) that resulted in a reduction of up to 89.30% (221 mg/dL) and 44.7% (543 U/L) on TG and lipase, respectively. Symptoms resolved completely. A fourth and short hospitalization occurred in the last semester, referring the aforementioned symptoms but lipase concentrations were 443 mg/dL.\\nOver this year, fibrates have been rotated from gemfibrozil to fenofibrate and ciprofibrate due to fluctuations on TG levels (). She was also prescribed metformin, orlistat and eicosapentaenoic acid with a mild effect. The ambulatory comprehensive analysis included a transthoracic echocardiogram that only reported a mildly-enlarged left atrium (diameter: 42 mm and volume: 37 mL/m2) and a carotid duplex ultrasound which found no atherosclerosis. Evaluation of cardiovascular risk revealed a low 10-year risk of myocardial infarction or death of 2.3% (adjusted Framingham score for Colombian population).",

He received a 3 mg/kg nivolumab adjuvant therapy every two weeks for 12 months (26 cycles). Three months after the beginning of the infusions, he developed painful nodules and abscesses of the axillary folds and groins. Most lesions cleared or drained spontaneously but there were new flares every week, requiring sometimes surgical drainage. The patient had a history of severe acne during puberty. He had no personal/family history of HS and no other medical condition associated with metabolic syndrome. On examination, there were inflammatory nodules and plaques, abscesses, but no fistula nor scars (A,B). Bacterial culture on pus swab from a fistulated abscess and folliculitis were positives for a Streptococcus Agalactiae group B and a Staphylococcus Epidermidis.\\nA diagnosis of nivolumab-HS, stage Hurley 1 was made. Following an unsuccessful three month-period lymecycline 300 mg q.d. therapy, he received a combination of doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. and zinc gluconate 60 mg q.d. The doxycycline was discontinued after one week because of the occurrence of gastro-intestinal symptoms. The patient was finally maintained under zinc gluconate alone with an excellent outcome (C).

        "note": "A 37-year-old woman purposely came to the outpatient department of our district hospital in the North West Region of Cameroon for a refill of her propranolol medication. She reported taking the drug routinely for palpitations. On further inquiry, she reported being well until 12 months prior to presentation when she suddenly became aware of her heartbeat, initially on moderate exertion and then even at rest. It had been recurrent and lasting several minutes each time it occurred. It progressively became associated with dyspnoea initially on moderate exertion and then on mild exertion, such that she had to quit farming which was her main source of income. After consulting at various health facilities in the North West Region of Cameroon, she was prescribed irregular and alternate daily regimens of 40 mg propranolol and 0.25 mg digoxin which she had been taking for 12 months at the time she presented at our hospital. Although the medications conferred her some relieve, she noticed a progressive weight loss over the 12-months period prior to consulting at our hospital, from 85 to 58 kg despite an abnormal increase in her appetite for food. She also experienced frequent watery stools (averagely six times daily). About 6 months prior to presentation, she complained of heat intolerance and profuse sweating resulting in sleeping with minimal clothing. In addition, she noticed spontaneous resting tremors of her hands which started at the same time as the heat intolerance. Three months prior to presentation at our hospital, she noticed a painless lump on her neck that progressively increased in size.\\nOn reviewing her medical records, we noticed a number of investigations requested at various hospitals which she visited during the 8 months preceding her presentation at our hospital. These included electrocardiographs, echocardiograms, HIV tests, full blood counts, fasting blood sugar, thyroid hormone assays, which were all without particularity but for the electrocardiography results which always showed a sinus tachycardia. She has no known history of exposure to radiations or family history of malignancies.\\nPhysical examination revealed a chronically ill-looking middle aged woman. Her eyes were normal (Fig. ). Her voice was clear. She had fine resting tremors of her hands with her arms outstretched. There was a left anterolateral neck mass measuring 4 \u00d7 3 cm (Fig. ). The mass was rubbery, mobile, non-tender, moved with swallowing, and not fixed to overlying or underlying tissue. No bruit was heard over the mass. There was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Her vital signs were normal but for regular respiratory and pulse rates of 35 breaths/min and 104 beats/min respectively.",

She was hospitalized for evaluation of dyspnea and chest pain; she was found to have bilateral pneumothoraces. She was intubated for respiratory failure and had chest tubes placed. She was found to have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. She required mechanical ventilation for a total of 3 months.\\nDuring her hospitalization, ART was initiated and an undetectable viral load was achieved. Although she subsequently was found to have viremia owing first to resistance mutations and later to medication nonadherence, she has maintained an undetectable HIV viral load since 2013. Her most recent CD4 lymphocyte count is 588/mm3. Her current ART program includes etravirine, dolutegravir, and ritonavir-boosted darunavir.\\nSix months after her prolonged hospitalization in 2010, she had a pulmonary function test that showed no obstruction and significant restriction (total lung capacity was 48.5% of predicted). She was using inhaled beclomethasone twice daily and an albuterol inhaler as needed at the time of testing. Upon her evaluation in the pulmonary clinic in 2016, she complained of a frequent nonproductive cough that had been persistent since her illness in 2010, and although she functionally recovered after her critical illness, she continued to have significant dyspnea on exertion.

She had occasional wheezing and reported triggers included strong odors, seasonal changes, and her current living space. After her critical illness in 2010, she moved into a rental property, which had to be renovated twice due to mold, and then in 2014 she moved to another property, in which water damage occurred from a leaking air conditioner. The carpet was taken up and dried but ultimately remained in the home. At that time, she began to feel her pulmonary symptoms worsen in regards to coughing frequency and endurance limitations; these symptoms progressed through the time of her initial pulmonary clinic appointment. She denied orthopnea or lower extremity edema. She was a life-long nonsmoker and did not use illicit drugs.\\nOn examination, she was in no acute distress, and she was obese with oxygen saturation 100% on pulse oximetry at room air with no desaturation on ambulation.",

        "note": "A 23-year-old married woman was admitted to hospital because of primary amenorrhea and\\nfailed sexual intercourse for 5 years. The patient was able to urinate, but not smoothly,\\nand she had leakage of urine for as long as she could remember, especially after running or\\na long walk. Although the amount of urine leakage was small, a protective pad still needed\\nto be used. She had undergone laparotomy (her operation record was unavailable and details\\nwere unknown) because of lower abdominal pain with poor urination more than 15 years\\npreviously. After this operation, her abdominal pain disappeared, but leakage of urine was\\nnot relieved. Growth and development of this patient were similar to other normal peers, and\\nher intelligence was normal. She married at the age of 21 years without a history of\\npregnancy. Her father and husband are healthy, but her mother died in a car accident many\\nyears previously. Through information provided by her father, we learned that her mother had\\nnot taken any special drugs during pregnancy. The patient was an only child with no similar\\nmedical history among her family members.\\nAfter a physical examination, we found that bilateral breast development of the patient was\\nnormal. The vulvar fissure was short with only one opening in the vestibule. The urethra and\\nvagina opened together in the vaginal vestibule. Additionally, urine was flowing out of the\\ncommon mouth in forced urination. On a rectoabdominal examination, there was a hard mass of\\napproximately 8 cm in front of the rectum. The activity of the mass was poor, but the\\nboundary was still clear. When the mass was pushed, urine flowed out of the common opening.\\nAn 18F latex catheter was inserted into the common opening, which was approximately 14 cm\\ndeep, and a small amount of turbid liquid was drained, accompanied by obvious stench. The\\ndrainage fluid was found to be urine and a routine urine test showed leukocytes (+++). Her\\nserum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCAg) level was 25.10 \u03bcg/L (reference range:\\n<1.50 \u03bcg/L). An ultrasonic examination and diagnosis after indwelling catheter indicated\\nurethral\u2013vaginal fistula. The catheter was in the vagina and showed an abnormal echo in the\\nvagina (which might have been foreign matter). A magnetic resonance examination and pelvic\\ncomputed tomography examination showed endovaginal dense foreign matter, which was\\nendovaginal effusion.\\nUsing combined diagnosis and treatment of radiology, ultrasound, urology, gynecology, and\\nother disciplines, the patient was diagnosed with UGS malformation, a vaginal calculus, and\\nprimary amenorrhea. The nursing diagnosis for our patient was altered urinary elimination,\\nsexual dysfunction, and a risk of perioperative injury. After full preparation, the patient\\nunderwent an operation for extraction of the vaginal calculus, urethroplasty, vaginoplasty,\\nand hysteroscopy on 19 March 2019. The hard calculus was oval in shape and was located in\\nthe urethra\u2013vagina, approximately 3 cm from the opening of the vestibule, and was\\napproximately 8 cm in diameter with a glazed surface. The calculus was close to the\\nposterior wall of the vagina, but there was no adhesion. The genitourinary tract was almost\\nclosed, resulting in an inability to expose the urethral orifice and cervical orifice. Under\\ntraction of obstetric forceps, the calculus was successfully removed by using a curved S\\npull hook. The size of the calculus was approximately 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 cm and the weight was 455 g\\n( and ). After the calculus was removed, we\\nrepaired laceration of the rectal mucosa and the posterior vaginal wall. The urethra and\\nvaginal space were separated and lower urethra reconstruction was performed to extend the\\nurethra to 4 cm. Furthermore, the vaginal mucosa was sutured discontinuously and the vagina\\nwas prolonged to 8 cm. Hysteroscopy showed that the endometrium was thin and the openings of\\nboth fallopian tubes were visible. After vaginal formation, two fingers could be\\naccommodated with no vaginal defecation. One week after the operation, she was discharged\\nwith a catheter and her serum SCCAg level had decreased to the normal range.\\nFor successful completion of the operation, we performed adequate perioperative nursing\\ncare.\\nAlthough the patient had undergone her laparotomy 15 years previously, the problem of\\nurine leakage was not resolved and she had a poor quality of life. We eventually\\ndiscovered the psychological and social situation of the patient, and took more\\ninitiative to care for her and gained her full trust. Furthermore, we set up a special\\nnursing team to communicate with her husband face to face. In particular, we also\\ncommunicated with the patient through mobile phone chat software, which is not affected\\nby time and space, and can also protect her personal privacy.\\nLong-term poor drainage of urine led to formation of liquid accumulation. To avoid\\nretrograde urinary tract infection after the operation performed in 2019, 1 week before\\noperation, 0.5% povidone iodine solution was used for a vaginal rinse twice daily. We\\nremoved the scalp needle from a disposable transfusion device and connected it with\\nflushing fluid. When the patient was in the bladder stone cutting position, we fully\\nlubricated the front end of the transfusion device, opened the regulator to rinse the\\nvulva first, and then gently inserted the rubber tube into the common hole approximately\\n0.5 cm. We slowly and gently washed the whole wall of the hole. Finally, the blood\\ntransfusion device was slowly withdrawn while washing and drying the vulva after full\\ndischarge of fluid in the hole. Additionally, this patient was provided oral tinidazole\\ntablets (1 g once a day) for 5 days to prevent retrograde urinary tract infection.\\nTo prevent defecation from polluting the visual field of the operation, the patient\\nbegan to eat a residue-free and semi-fluid/liquid diet 3 days before the operation. One\\nday before the operation, the patient had a liquid diet for lunch and dinner. Food was\\nstopped at midday and drinking water was stopped at 4 am on the day of the operation.\\nAdditionally, 1 day before the operation, the patient was treated with compound\\npolyethylene glycol electrolyte for total gastrointestinal lavage. The number of defecations caused by total gastrointestinal lavage and cleaning\\nenema was increased and excessive dampness of the skin was prone to mechanical damage. Therefore, we guided the patient to wipe with soft paper towels to reduce local\\nfriction and clean the anus with warm water to reduce local irritation.\\nWe closely observed the amount, color, odor, and characteristics of vaginal bleeding\\nand exudation. Attention was paid to whether there was gas and defecation in the vagina,\\nand to the occurrence of rectovaginal fistula. Perineal irrigation was prohibited to\\nprevent retrograde infection and was replaced by perineal scrubbing twice a day. After\\nremoving perineal sutures on the fourth day after the operation, we encouraged the\\npatient to get out of bed to facilitate drainage of vaginal blood and secretions.\\nThe patient had a fever on the first day after the operation, but her body temperature\\ndid not exceed 38\u00b0C. Because she underwent rectal repair during the operation, her\\ndoctor ordered fasting and careful use of rectal medicine. Therefore, physical cooling\\nwas the first choice in the case of body fever. We warmed 0.9% saline ice bags until the\\nice was semi-melted into frosty water because the ice bags after melting were soft and\\neasy to fix, and increased the heat dissipation area in contact with the forehead.\\nIn the process of pain management, the primary responsibility of nurses was to screen,\\nevaluate, and record the pain of the patient, and report to the doctor for timely\\ntreatment as required. We used the visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess the degree of\\npain and encouraged the patient to express her feelings. The postoperative VAS score of\\nthe patient ranged from 1 to 4, and no severe pain was observed. When the patient was in\\nmild pain (VAS score: 0\u20133 points), the pain and anxiety were relieved by playing her\\nfavorite music with a slow rhythm. When the patient was in moderate pain (VAS score: 4\u20136\\npoints), we contacted her doctor and provided compound paracetamol tablets for oral\\nanalgesia according to the doctor\u2019s advice. The analgesic effect was good after the\\nmedication.\\nIn contrast to other patients who gradually change from liquid and semi-liquid to soft\\nfood and a normal diet according to recovery of intestinal function, our patient fasted\\nfor 1 week and was supplied with total parenteral nutrition. Additionally, diphenoxylate\\ntablets were taken to inhibit intestinal peristalsis because of the operation for rectal\\nrepair. We regularly observed vaginal gas, drainage, or defecation of the patient and\\nrecorded these occurrences. On the seventh day after the operation, the patient was\\nallowed to drink 50 mL of boiled water that had been cooled to a warm temperature to\\nobserve whether there was discomfort. We then gradually increased the patient\u2019s food\\nintake. On the eighth day after the operation, the patient discharged soft yellow stool\\nonce without obstruction, and there were no abnormal secretions or feces found in\\nvagina. The patient then gradually transitioned to soft food and we ensured that her\\nstool remained lubricated to prevent obstruction.\\nThe patient was kept in bed for 4 days after lithotomy for 6 hours, and the patient wore graduated compression stockings before entering the operating\\nroom and wore them for 18 hours a day. When the patient was no longer bedridden, we\\ninstructed her to exercise properly according to the degree of physical tolerance.",

Further history from the patient revealed that he had been treated for symptomatic anaemia for the past two years. On clinical examination, he was pale, tachycardic but normotensive. His abdominal examination was unremarkable and digital rectal examination revealed melena. Initial investigations revealed a drop of haemoglobin from 11\u202fg/dl to 4\u202fg/dl. He was promptly resuscitated with blood products, and an early upper endoscopy was performed.\\nThe index oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) showed a small Forrest 3 antral ulcer with multiple subcentimeter gastric polyps []. The gastric polyps were biopsied, and the histopathology subsequently reveals it to be benign. A colonoscopy showed blood-stained colonic mucosa in its entirety. However, no bleeding source was identified. An urgent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen was performed which revealed no significant abnormality. There were no bowel related masses seen. After the acute gastrointestinal bleeding episode subsided, we proceeded to work him up with a presumptive diagnosis of possible small intestinal bleed.\\nCapsule endoscopy was performed which showed several small telangiectasias in the proximal part of the small bowel (). There was no visible tumour, polyps or ulcers. A double-balloon enteroscopy was then performed. It showed abnormal vascularity with a central umbilication over the mucosa of the small bowel (). The mucosal abnormality was located at 165\u202fcm from the incisor. Preoperative assessment of the patient showed he has an ASA score of 1.",

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed several loops of small bowel in the right side of the abdomen with thickening immediately adjacent to the VP shunt concerning for inflammation of the bowel (). CT head revealed areas of acute infarct seen involving the brain stem as well as the cerebellar hemispheres and moderate enlargement of the ventricular system with left-sided intraventricular hemorrhage (Figures and ). Due to the acute nature of her abdomen and the concern for a seeded VP shunt from this intra-abdominal infection, neurosurgery was consulted.

The lesion was solid, centrally located, measuring 16\u00d715 mm, with smooth margins, and caused partial atelectasis of the middle lobe with no enlarged lymph nodes. During video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) exploration performed at another institution, the neoplasm in the middle lobe was visualized, as well as multiple small yellowish foci on the parietal pleura, upon which basis pleural dissemination was suspected. Thus, wedge resection of the middle lobe with the entire lesion and biopsy of the parietal pleura were performed. According to the morphologic examination, an atypical carcinoid was verified, the resection margins were clear, and pleural carcinomatosis was confirmed. The patient was treated with octreotide (20 mg once in 28 days) since she had mild symptoms of carcinoid syndrome (the recurrent feeling of blood rushing to the face). Twelve months after surgery, local recurrence was suspected based on follow-up CT ().

Furthermore, up to the last CKD phase, the progression trajectory had been relatively slow, after which a relatively rapid increase in creatinine was observed in the course of 1 year (creatinine 1.52 mg/dl in February 2007, 2.5 mg/dl in November 2015, 2.7 mg/dl in January 2016, 3.1 mg/dl in March 2016).\\nIn June 2016 Mr. H was hospitalised for a further reduction in kidney function, probably after an oligo-symptomatic infection (C-reactive protein 71 mg/l, fibrinogen: 7.44 g/l). At hospitalisation, serum creatinine had reached 7.5 mg/dl, with severe acidosis (bicarbonate 15 mEq/l) and anaemia (haemoglobin 7.9 g/dl).

        "note": "A 28-year-old mestizo man with a 3-year history of inflammatory arthritis and dry mouth and eyes was admitted to our hospital. He was admitted to our hospital at the request of an external consultant in January 2008; the initial laboratory evaluation is listed in Table . Methotrexate was initiated with good response; 1 year later methotrexate was changed to leflunomide because of liver toxicity. Globulin levels at admission and 1 year after were 5.2 and 7.2g/dL, respectively. Of interest, although he also had positive anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and anti-nucleosomes antibodies, which normally have a higher specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, at admission we could not make a diagnosis because of the absence of clinical manifestations other than arthritis and sicca.\\nHyperemia and mild eye pain appeared in March 2009, and a diffuse scleritis was diagnosed. Therefore leflunomide was suspended and he received prednisone (1mg/kg), tapered to 5mg/day in 1 month and suspended after another month because a mouth ulcer appeared.\\nMultiple important mucosal bleeding episodes (epistaxis and gingival hemorrhage) started in 2009, and coagulation tests were conducted through 2010, with the following results: prothrombin time, international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin times were normal (11/10.4 seconds; 1.2; 31.1/26.9 seconds, respectively), VWF activity was observed with low ristocetin cofactor (RCo) at 33.6UI/dL, high VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) >200UI/dL, and a low VWF:RCo to VWF:Ag ratio. Furthermore, an Ivy bleeding time test of more than 15 minutes and normal factor VIII activity (70UI/dL) were observed. An in vitro test showed that the patient\u2019s IgG inhibited the VWF:RCo of normal plasma, therefore the RCo activity inhibition test was positive, although this was not necessary for the diagnosis. A characteristic aVWD laboratory test with the identification of a causal underlying disease, integrated the diagnosis [].\\nThe patient was admitted to the ER in April 2011 with a 24-hour evolution of progressive dyspnea, cough, thoracic pain, and palpitations, 104beats/minute, 60/40mmHg, temperature of 38\u00b0C, pulse oximetric saturation 88% and 30 breaths/minute. Cold, pale and mottled skin was also observed; laboratory values at ER admission are listed in Table . There were no signs of arthritis or bleeding. Initial crystalloid reanimation was made with partial response, and persistent tachypnea and hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen = 245.7) precluded a rapid intubation sequence. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) 12 hours later. Initial laboratory ER patient data are listed in Table ; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment values at ICU admission were 11 and 27 points respectively.\\nAn electrocardiogram showed an incomplete right bundle block not previously detected. A chest X-ray revealed no infiltrates, and complementary laboratory tests did not suggest a related infection. The placement of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) was made under the indication of a differentiation between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic shock (see Table ). The initial patterns showed a precapillary pulmonary hypertension; therefore, in the autoimmune context of the patient, although serial negative antiphospholipid antibodies were noted in his history, acute pulmonary embolism was the first choice for diagnosis. Pulmonary angiography was conducted, and when no clot was discovered, PAH associated with connective tissue disease was considered because pulmonary hypertension has been historically associated with connective tissue diseases.\\nThese PAC parameters were the same as observed by Condliffe et al. [] and Murata et al. [] except for the pulmonary vascular resistance index, which was greater in our patient in comparison to the Condliffe et al. cases (715 versus 1525 dyne\u00b7second/(cm5\u00b7m2)). Because connective tissue disease may cause PAH because of the vasculature pathology, the difference in more severe resistance may be explained by the changes in the rheological properties (1 poise (P) = 1g\u00b7(second\u00b7cm)-1 = 1dyne\u00b7second/cm2) present in the HVS, where a decrease in the blood flow can explain the resistance increase. Laboratory blood samples hinted about the thickness of blood, so viscosity was measured and found to be 65.8cP (<1.9cP).\\nLymphadenopathy and organomegaly were ruled out. A bone marrow biopsy did not show clonality of plasma cells. Serum protein electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a massive polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and no paraproteinemia or monoclonal cell population was found from the electrophoretic pattern of the patient\u2019s plasma. Hypergammaglobulinemia was the cause of HVS associated with autoantibodies. Three sessions of plasma exchange therapy were made. Albumin and frozen fresh plasma were used as the expander, and one circulating blood volume was utilized. Significant mental, hemodynamic recovery and clinical outcomes became evident. A negative Q value was observed in the HVS in this patient after taking into account the Starling vascular permeability formula, where the microvasculature is influenced by protein content and transcapillary fluid flux, specifically, where Q is equal to volume of flow across the capillary wall. This finding led to the conclusion that dilution of protein content may alleviate the HVS, and the fluid administration was considered supportive therapy with judicious consideration of the compartment shift of the solutions.

The patient is an intelligent, independent, acculturated woman who lives alone in the French countryside.\\nHer medical history is complex: she was treated with lithium for about 20 years (from age 20 to 40). This was discontinued after she developed CKD; in recent years, under treatment with valproic acid and lamotrigine, her psychophysical balance has been good,.\\nShe started smoking when she was 19 years old (30 cigarettes/day) and developed a smoke-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was obese in early adulthood; arterial hypertension was diagnosed at age 30 and type 2 diabetes at age 32, treated using oral hypoglycemic drugs, but she eventually lost about 20 kg, making it possible for antidiabetic drugs to be discontinued. She underwent total thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma at age 41, and started levothyroxine therapy afterwards. Due to a progressive worsening of the kidney function she started hemodialysis at age 50. Her kidney disease was probably multifactorial (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heavy smoking, lithium therapy).\\nSeven years after dialysis start, she underwent left hemicolectomy for colon adenocarcinoma, and two years later, left quadrantectomy followed by radiotherapy for ductal mammary adenocarcinoma. She underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy for severe tertiary hyperparathyroidism at age 62. Due to the presence of severe scoliosis, and the development of peripheral neuropathy, she uses painkillers regularly.\\nAt the time of the present report, she was on thriceweekly hemodiafiltration, with good dialysis tolerance and high dialysis efficiency (Daugirdas 2 Kt/V: 1.6\u20131.8).\\nHer most recent treatment included antihypertensive drugs (spironolactone 100 mg, amlodipine 20 mg, perindopril 2.5 mg), antipsychotic drugs (valproic acid 600 mg, lamotrigine 100 mg), thyroid hormone (levothyroxine 150 \u03bcg), vitamin D, bicarbonate and calcium supplements (calcium carbonate 1 g, sodium bicarbonate 500 mg, vitamin D 25-OH 100,000 UI once a month), potassium and phosphate binders (sodium polystyrene sulphonate, on non-dialysis days and sevelamer 2.4 g per day), darbopoietin 20 \u03bccg once weekly.\\nThe clinical examination revealed a woman with good psychophysical balance, a moderate impairment in nutritional status, and a severe comorbidity burden (weight 54 Kg, height 155, BMI: 23 Kg/m2; subjective global assessment: B; malnutrition inflammation index: 10).",

He has splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy occurred in the neck, axilla, mediastinum and celiac on physical examination and computed tomography scan. A detailed clinical work-up for infection, immune and malignant diseases were performed. His CD4 count was 48 cells/\u03bcl and HIV viral load was 8596 copies/ml. Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia. Serological testing for cryptococcus, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus was unrevealing (Table ). Furthermore, peripheral blood cultures incubated for 5 days were also negative. Hemophagocytosis could be seen on bone marrow smears (Fig. a), complied with fever, splenomegaly, three-line cytopenia, high level of serum ferritin and soluble CD25, supporting the diagnosis of HPS. A lymph node biopsy with the highest standardized uptake value (SUV = 6.0) provided by a positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET\u2013CT) scan revealed nonspecific lymphocyte proliferation. Pathological imaging of lymph node biopsy showed nonspecific lymphocyte proliferation and excluded malignancy.\\nTo find the cause of HPS, a MGS assay of plasma was performed and the result revealed a HHV8 viremia of 5621 unique reads with coverage of identified viral genes 94.93% (Fig. b\u2013d).

        "note": "A 68-year-old man was examined in the outpatient department of our hospital by transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) because the attending cardiologist suspected mitral valve endocarditis. The patient\u2019s medical history revealed permanent AF, drug-, and hepatitis E-induced liver cirrhosis (CHILD Score B) being on vitamin-K-antagonist (VKA), a biological aortic valve replacement in 2011 and long-standing hypertension. Due to a history of cirrhosis-associated major gastric bleeding complications in February 2014, while being on VKA and rheumatoid arthritis with long-term glucocorticoid therapy, an LAA closure procedure was planned 3 months later in our hospital. At that time, the patient had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 points (age 65\u201374 years +1 and hypertension +1) and a HAS-BLED score of 5 points (age, hypertension, abnormal liver function, labile International Normalized Ratio (INR), and prior major bleeding; each +1). Despite antihypertensive combination therapy, including a diuretic, the patient\u2019s blood pressure remained increased. Therefore, in combination with the glucocorticoid therapy, the bleeding risk (estimated risk 9\u201312%) was substantially higher than the risk for ischaemic stroke (estimated at 2.2%). At the time, guidelines did not recommend direct oral anticoagulants as an alternative to VKA use as there was insufficient data. As a result, a percutaneous LAA closure was performed in May 2014 and a 33-mm WATCHMAN device was implanted in the LAA of a chicken wing type and a left atrial (LA) size of 22 cm2. The WATCHMAN device size was chosen based on a maximum LAA ostium size of 30 mm, for which a 33-mm WATCHMAN device is recommended. The manufacturer\u2019s standard guidelines and recommendations were followed and the procedure was performed without any adverse events. Post-interventional TOE assessment showed an appropriate closure of the LAA. The patient was discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) comprising aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 3 months, to which he was compliant.\\nIn July 2015, the patient was diagnosed with an ischaemic stroke due to the occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and carotid endarterectomy performed. A TOE performed at the time showed no intracardiac thrombus. Systemic lysis was performed, which resulted in intracranial bleeding.",

He presented with a medical history of chronic atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower extremities, alcoholic liver disease, and diabetes mellitus. For the treatment of atrial fibrillation, he was using the DOAC edoxaban, which is a selective, reversible, and competitive inhibitor of human factor Xa.\\nRadiography showed no evidence of hip fracture but revealed a thickening of left psoas major muscle, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed stable-type VCF of the fourth lumbar vertebra (Fig. ). Moreover, fast STIR MRI revealed a 53- \u00d7 54- \u00d7 142-mm intramuscular hematoma in the psoas major muscle, which expanded to the iliac muscle and around the hip joint (Fig. ). Computed tomography angiography showed that the hematoma arose from the ruptured segmental artery running around the fractured vertebra (Fig. ). Blood tests showed platelets of 149,000/mm3 (normal, 140,000\u2013400,000), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 30.1 s (normal, 26\u201340 sections), and slightly prolonged international normalized ratio of prothrombin time of 1.25 (normal, 0.90\u20131.10). Creatinine was 1.22 mg/dL (normal, 0.5\u20131.0 mg/dL), with a creatinine clearance of 44.8 mL/min.\\nBased on the analysis of the blood coagulation system, we estimated that extravasation from the segmental artery was encouraged not by depletion of coagulation factors due to liver disorder but by DOAC usage, which does not affect APTT. Interrupting the anticoagulant therapy was considered to pose a risk of stroke because the patient exhibited a CHADS2 score (defined as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u2265 75 years, type 2 diabetes mellitus, previous stroke [doubled]) of 3 points.",

He had visited the emergency room with similar symptoms several months previously and was treated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia.\\nOn presentation, the patient was febrile to 38.7\u02daC with otherwise normal vitals. X-ray was significant for a large left-sided pleural effusion with an opacity at the left lung base. He was again prescribed a course of azithromycin and discharged home from the emergency room.\\nAt a subsequent outpatient visit, lung ultrasound demonstrated a persistent pleural effusion for which he underwent a therapeutic thoracentesis with the removal of 1.3 L serosanguinous fluid. His symptoms of cough and shortness of breath returned within 1 week. Therefore, a thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy and tunnelled pleural catheter placement was performed. Biopsy revealed non-specific inflammation. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan after the procedure revealed a small loculated left pleural effusion, volume loss at the periphery of the left lower lobe, and a new finding of marked narrowing of the left PVs.\\nGiven these findings, a cardiac catherization was performed. Intra-procedural trans-oesophageal echocardiography revealed severe stenosis of the common trunk of the left upper and lower PVs. Balloon angioplasty of the stenotic ostium was performed with a dual kissing balloon technique. Mean pre-procedural Doppler gradient on echocardiography was 7 mmHg, which decreased to 3.8 mmHg post-procedure (). Following the procedure, he was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and apixaban to maintain stent patency.\\nThe patient\u2019s recovery was complicated by recurrence of symptoms several weeks later. Repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of the left pulmonary venous antrum. In the second procedure, the lesion was pre-dilated, and a 10 mm diameter by 20 mm long bare-metal stent was placed from the PV ostium to the point of bifurcation. The patient was continued on apixaban and clopidogrel to maintain stent patency and for recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Over the following 5 years, he had two small-sized haemoptysis episodes related to PV stent restenosis (). Symptoms were alleviated after repeat angioplasty.",

        "note": "The patient was an 87-year-old female who was hospitalized on 19 March 2016 for heart failure in chronic AF and recent GI bleeding for hemorrhoids. In addition, she had comorbid arterial hypertension, asthma, osteoporosis, and allergy to acetylsalicylic acid. During previous anticoagulant treatment with sodium enoxaparin, the patient had experienced rectal bleeding that resulted from a fecaloma with hemorrhoid rupture. At the time of hospital admission, she had been receiving treatment with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (bid), furosemide 25 mg bid, canrenone 100 mg once daily (od), bisoprolol 1.25 mg bid, pantoprazole 40 mg od, fluticasone/salmeterol 250/25 \u00b5g 2 puffs bid, and tiotropium 2.5 \u00b5g 2 puffs od.\\nIn the days following hospital admission, the patient developed fever and dyspnea, with high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, azithromycin, and prednisone 25 mg at tapering doses. Despite increasing doses of diuretics, her heart failure worsened; the patient was moved to the cardiology unit, where an echocardiography showed a moderate-to-severe mitral insufficiency, biatrial dilatation, and bilateral pleural effusion. Following clinical improvement from treatment (which also included oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure), the patient was transferred to the subacute care unit.\\nOn 30 April, major hemorrhoidal bleeding occurred; the patient was awake with hypotension (blood pressure 90/50 mm/Hg), tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm), and SpO2 94% breathing room air. A Foley catheter was inserted into the rectum (inflated at 40 cc) and surrounded by a Spongostan hemostatic sponge, but this only resulted in a minor reduction in bleeding. Bleeding continued, and the patient became drowsy (blood pressure 80/40 mm/Hg, heart rate 130 bpm, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, compared with 11.7 g/dL the previous day, and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.2). Subsequently, the patient was taken to the operating theater in hemorrhagic shock caused by massive proctorrhagia; blood pressure rose to 100/40 mm/Hg after infusion of Emagel (polygeline) 500. Rectoscopy detected two bleeding mucosal lesions near the anal sphincter, possibly caused by friction of hard stools. The surgeon found widespread mucosal inflammation, but no indication for surgical repair. Upon rectal examination, the surgeon found hemorrhoid congestion with two bleeding lesions at 3 o\u2019clock, which were sutured by applying a double Spongostan tampon. Following surgery, the patient regained consciousness without complications (blood pressure 104/55 mm/Hg, heart rate 120 bpm, and SaO2 99% in O2 2L via nasal cannula), although some rectal bleeding persisted after the removal of the local compression with Foley catheter in traction. The laboratory data gave a thrombin time (TT) >140 and <20 before and after surgery, respectively, and an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) >50 before surgery. After hemostatic measures were conducted on 30 April, including transfusion of Emagel 500 cc, 3 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 2 units of packed red blood cells, as well as tranexamic acid in 2 doses of 20 mg/kg intravenously, idarucizumab 5 g (2 \u00d7 2.5 g/50 mL) was administered in order to reverse the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran. Administration of idarucizumab was not initiated sooner because of practical considerations related to availability. Due to the massive perioperative bleeding, idarucizumab was administered by rapid infusion, resulting in complete cessation of bleeding after approximately 8 h. The dabigatran level, as assessed by the dilute thrombin time (dTT), was189 ng/mL before surgery and 30 mg/mL 12 h after idarucizumab administration. The patient remained under monitoring in the intensive care unit for 4 days without complications. Post-operative thromboprophylaxis was initiated on day 4 with enoxaparin 4000 IU bid.\\nComplete recovery of the patient took place in about 15 days, with stabilization of clinical parameters and mobilization from bed to chair. No further evidence of rectal bleeding was observed. On 15 May, assessments were made to determine the feasibility of resuming dabigatran treatment. The delay in restarting the treatment was caused by the initial refusal by and the subsequent indecision of the patient and her relatives to consent to the resumption of the drug. During this time, thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin bid was maintained.",

        "note": "A 69-year-old woman with repaired TOF suffering from recurrent haemoptysis was referred to our institution for further investigations. She underwent palliation in 1962 (age 12) with a classic right-sided BTT shunt and TOF repair in 1967 (age 17) with closure of the VSD, relief of the RV outflow tract obstruction, and closure of the BTT shunt. Over the course of the years, she developed atrial fibrillation for which she was started on oral anticoagulation. In 1993, she had a first episode of massive haemoptysis which was treated conservatively. In 2002, computed tomography (CT) indicated a stellate nodule in the right upper lung lobe. Over the next years the lesion remained stable on axial follow-up imaging. In 2019, after new episodes of haemoptysis, this time with progressively worsening dyspnoea, a positron emission tomography\u2013CT was performed showing isotope accumulation in the lesion of the right upper lung lobe (). She underwent a bronchoscopy that showed mucosal swelling in the right upper lobe. Cytology indicated acute inflammation without evidence of malignancy.\\nOn physical examination, the right-sided radial pulse was absent and blood pressure (BP) not measurable. Blood pressure and heart rate taken on the left arm were 112/45 mmHg and 78 b.p.m., respectively. Respiratory rate was 22 per minute. The second heart sound was pronounced with a grade 3/6 systolic and 2/4 diastolic murmur at the second intercostal space on the left. C-reactive protein was normal (2.9 mg/L) and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide slightly elevated (733 ng/L). The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with inferolateral ST depression and Q-waves in V1\u2013V2\u2013aVR (). Transthoracic echocardiography indicated a moderately dilated RV with normal systolic function, a peak/mean gradient of 53/32 mmHg across the pulmonary valve with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation ().\\nA diagnostic cardiac catheterization was performed but no arteriovenous connections were seen and the BTT shunt was not patent. Right atrial pressure was 14 mmHg, RV systolic pressure 56 mmHg, systolic pulmonary artery pressure 33 mmHg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure 21 mmHg. The RV was dilated with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation. A bronchoscopy with EndoBronchial UltraSound (EBUS) in order to perform EBUS guided biopsy was performed. A rope-like structure was seen through the bronchoscope, but we were unable to take a biopsy ().\\nAfter multidisciplinary discussion, the findings appeared to be most consistent with chronic inflammation due to a foreign body with secondary chronic inflammation, rather than vasculitis or a granulomatous infection, and the patient underwent a thoracotomy with lobectomy of the superior lobe of the right lung. The foreign body was removed without any resistance nor bleeding. Pathology indicated diffuse necrotizing granulomatous inflammation around the rope-like structure ( and ) which appeared to be the old suture around the BTT shunt that had caused a chronic inflammatory reaction invading the right upper bronchus and causing haemoptysis. The patient remained stable after the procedure. She left the hospital after a couple of days. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. After 3 months, she underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement. After the surgical intervention,",

        "note": "A 92-year-old woman was accompanied to the Emergency Department in a coma status (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 7) with feces loss and fever (39.5\u00b0C). Blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 25 breaths/minute, and arterial blood oxygen saturation was 92% while breathing on room air. Furthermore, the physical examination revealed a systolic mitralic murmur and an inflamed area on perimalleolar skin on the right leg (). The personal medical history included hypertension, mild cognitive impairment related to vascular encephalopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and bleeding complications after falls during anticoagulant therapy. The patient did not take any immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drug at home. At admission, the electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmed atrial fibrillation with normal heart rate. Laboratory blood tests demonstrated a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13,160/mm3, haemoglobin of 159 g/L, lactic acid of 2.5 mmol/L, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin I of 0.238 \u03bcg/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 6.2 mg/L, and lactic dehydrogenase of 252 U/L. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan with angiographic sequences demonstrated the complete occlusion of the right intracranial vertebral artery, diffused signs of leukoencephalopathy, and no haemorrhages (). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excluded a recent cerebral ischemia but confirmed the occlusion of the right intracranial vertebral artery (). Total body CT scan was not able to detect any macroscopic foci of infection or cancer. The Doppler ultrasound examination of leg arteries and veins as well as carotid arteries did not detect any thrombosis and/or stenosis. Blood cultures were performed and, while waiting for the isolation time, an empirical antimicrobial treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started together with supportive therapies. No significant clinical improvement was observed, and inflammatory biomarkers, such as procalcitonin (with a peak of 4.0 \u00b5g/L) and CRP (with a peak of 200 mg/L), increased. On the other hand, troponin I blood concentration rapidly reached the normal values.\\nA targeted antimicrobial therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam was immediately started, in association with gentamicin in order to obtain a synergistic antimicrobial activity in consideration of the possible diagnosis of endocarditis. After one day of such a therapy, the patient's consciousness restored and the fever stopped. On day four after the admission, three blood cultures resulted positive for Gram-negative coccobacilli. In the Microbiology Laboratory, blood samples were collected and inoculated in BD BACTEC\u2122 Plus Aerobic/F and Anaerobic/F culture vials and incubated in the automated system BD BACTEC. Positive aerobic specimens were seeded on blood and chocolate agar plates, giving round, grey, nonhaemolytic, nonmucoid pure colonies after 24 hours. Bacterial stain was identified as Pasteurella multocida with the automated biochemical testing Vitek 2 (BioMeri\u00e9ux Italia S.p.A., Grassina, Italy), which also performed antibiotic sensitivity, indicated in . Identification was confirmed with the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) VITEK MS (BioMeri\u00e9ux Italia S.p.A.). The transthoracic echocardiogram on day 10 did not show any endocarditic lesions, and the patient completely recovered. In the meanwhile, the patient could refer about the skin lesion due to her cat bite, occurring one week before her hospital admission. Since the cat was still living at the patient's home, a sample of its saliva was analyzed.\\nIn particular, a cat pharyngeal swab was performed and seeded on blood and chocolate agar plates and grew at 37\u00b0C in aerobic condition. After 24 hours, mixed bacterial colonies grew, from which an isolation on blood agar was performed to grow in anaerobic condition. The anaerobic growth gave the sole colonies the same look as the ones isolated from patient blood culture. Colonies from cat were identified as Pasteurella multocida through the same technologies, that is, the automated biochemical testing and the mass spectrometry. The antibiotic sensitivity of cat strain was analyzed with the Vitek system as well. The phenotype of sensitivity of the patient strain and cat strain was the same, and the related MIC values were similar (). In particular, cefotaxime MIC value of patient isolates was < 1 mg/L, while that of cat isolates was 1 mg/L. Such a quantitative diversity corresponds to the variability achievable with a strain alone ().\\nThe patient was discharged after 15 days of antimicrobial therapy (ampicillin/sulbactam and gentamicin). Additional blood cultures during antibiotic treatment were negative, and procalcitonin and CRP levels were reduced to 0.09 \u00b5g/L and 33.6 mg/L, respectively. Additional 15-day treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was recommended at home.",

Upon admission, the patient had a computed tomography (CT) score of 3/20 based on Chung and colleagues' criteria []. The patient had a significant medical history that included chronic iron deficiency anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, persistent atrial fibrillation, and chronic cerebral vasculopathy. She was receiving regular therapy with amiodarone, oral ferrous sulfate, ramipril, and aclidinium bromide. Prior to admission, she had received 2 units of packed red blood cells for severe anemia in the emergency department at the other hospital (Hb was 7.2 g/dl).\\nUpon admission, laboratory studies revealed a hematocrit of 32,7% (38 - 46%), microcytic anemia with hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (11.7 - 13.8 g/dL), a mean corpuscular volume of 74 fl (80-100fl). Ferritinemia was in the average range of 103 ng/mL (20-120 ng/dL) while transferrin saturation was only 10%. Levels of Hb and transferrin saturation during hospital recovery are shown in Figure .\\nOn day 1, inflammatory marker levels of IL-6 (<7) and C-reactive protein (0.5-1 mg/dL) were 20.2 pg/ml and 0.21 mg/dL, respectively. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) was negative, while the colonoscopy showed the presence of hemorrhoids and the search for occult blood was positive. Given the patient\u2019s history of chronic anemia and low transferrin saturation, she was given IV ferric carboxymaltose 1000 mg on day 4. On day 6, her Hb was 8.6 mg/dl, which further decreased to 8.3 mg/dl on day 9, while transferrin saturation improved to 22%.

        "note": "A 46-year-old woman with morbid obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, active smoking, and bipolar disorder was evaluated for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as an outpatient. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a right atrial mass close to the RA-IVC junction. A transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a pedunculated right atrial mobile bilobular mass measuring 2.1 \u00d7 1.8 cm, not arising from the interatrial septum with extension into the inferior vena cava (Figures \u2013). A secundum atrial septal defect was also identified. The patient was referred to cardiac surgery for resection of a presumed right atrial myxoma given the possibility of embolization. The intraoperative TEE suggested the presence of one bilobulated mass arising low in the right atrium.\\nUsing aortic and bicaval cannulation, a right atriotomy was performed and a discrete 2 \u00d7 3 cm mass was removed from the IVC-RA junction near the Eustachian valve. The right atrium was closed and the patient weaned from bypass. The specimen did not appear to be a myxoma, so it was sent for frozen section and interpreted as being ectopic liver tissue. In the interim, a repeat TEE showed an additional discrete 2 \u00d7 2 cm mass in the IVC near the hepatic veins. Femoral venous cannulation was then performed to allow for visualization of the IVC below the pericardial reflection. Through the same right atriotomy and using additional suction directly in the IVC, the IVC mass was visualized and resected. Both specimens were interpreted as showing partially encapsulated liver parenchyma with mild steatosis, fibrosis, ductal proliferation, and periductal chronic inflammation, consistent with ectopic hepatic tissue ().\\nDespite a brief period of cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient had persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure ascribed to her morbid obesity and underlying lung disease. She also developed extensive left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis from a presumed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia for which she was treated with argatroban and placement of an IVC filter. Because of chronic respiratory failure, she underwent tracheostomy and feeding tube placement, and she was placed on warfarin for intermittent atrial fibrillation.",

She had a loop recorder implant three years ago. The loop recorder was placed due to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) with intraocular changes identified by her ophthalmologist. Her loop recorder has consistently shown an average of 2-3 short runs of repetitive AT for 4-6 beats per day (Figure ), but never documented AF. She presented to an outside emergency department (ED) following a fall, aphasia and weakness after her spouse found her on the floor. Initial National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) was 2 (1 point for loss of consciousness and 1 point for aphasia), blood pressure (BP) was 170/97 mmHg, random blood glucose was 103 mg/dl. Electrocardiography (EKG) showed the patient to be in AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) with a heart rate (HR) of 219 beats per min (bpm). Troponins were unremarkable. She was given alteplase with improvement of symptoms for presumed left middle cerebral artery (MCA) embolic stroke and diltiazem for AF.\\nThe patient was then transferred to a tertiary care stroke center for further management. On arrival at the tertiary center, the patient\u2019s NIHSS was 3 (increased from 2), she was in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and diltiazem was discontinued. Physical examination revealed an HR of 68 bpm; BP was 119/53 mmHg. On neurological examination, she could not remember the year (but remembers the month and day); naming, repetition and comprehension were impaired. On motor examination, there was minimal decrease in the right hand-grip and right triceps. There was right lower extremity-drift and a decreased motor strength of 4/5. There was full motor strength of 5/5 on the left upper and lower extremity, sensory examination was intact throughout, and deep tendon reflexes were 2+. The patient was admitted to the neuro intensive care unit (NICU) for further stroke workup. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 65-70%, with small circumferential pericardial effusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a small patchy area of diffusion restriction involving the left temporoparietal region. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) also showed short segment stenotic lesions of the proximal left inferior M2 division. Carotid ultrasound was negative for any thrombus; there was a plaque in both bifurcations of no hemodynamic significance. The patient was started on metoprolol, aspirin, and atorvastatin. The electrophysiology team was consulted to evaluate the loop recorder.\\nShe continued to have expressive aphasia with irregularly irregular HR patterns. The patient continued falling in and out of AF with palpitations, HR increased to 160-180s. EKG revealed AF with ventricular rates into the 150s, non-specific ST segment and T wave changes, with no evidence of acute ischemia. Telemetry showed variable flutter and AF rates in the 150s-180s. Metoprolol was withheld on the second day of hospital admission due to bradycardia. Amiodarone and apixaban were commenced.",

A pill in the pocket approach had been adopted more recently. Additional past medical history included hypothyroidism, anxiety, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. There was no history of ischaemic heart disease or angina. Her regular medications included levothyroxine, mirtazapine, and omeprazole. Prior to initiation of flecainide, the electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated normal QRS and QTc intervals (), which remained normal throughout the course of treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out any structural heart disease, being completely normal.\\nAt presentation, the initial ECG demonstrated AF at a rate of 156 b.p.m. (). Clinical examination findings were normal and the patient was haemodynamically stable, with blood pressure (BP) of 146/104 mmHg. Blood tests, including full blood count, electrolytes, renal function, C-reactive protein, and coagulation were normal. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was slightly raised with normal free thyroxine (T4). Given the patient had tolerated flecainide well in the past, the emergency physician decided to try pharmacological cardioversion with IV flecainide. Weight was 107 kg, therefore, 150 mg over 10 min were administered (no oral flecainide had been taken). A therapeutic dose of subcutaneous enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg) was also administered, as she was not anticoagulated.",

The creatine kinase-MB was of 10 and high-sensitivity troponin I was of 6.0 ng/mL, with normal hemoglobin level and INR of 1.9. At baseline, a combined thromboembolic and bleeding scoring system evaluation was performed, resulting in a CHA2DS2-VASc of 4 and HAS-BLED of 3 [\u2013]. A NSTEMI diagnosis was made, and an antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose, and intravenous unfractionated heparin 5000 IU was administered, while an early invasive strategy with a transradial approach was planned.

        "note": "A 62-year-old Caucasian male with a history of successfully treated hepatitis C presented with diffuse abdominal pain. Workup with ultrasound and follow-up multiphase abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a heterogeneously enhancing and infiltrative liver mass measuring approximately 10 x 9 x 13 cm involving segments five through eight suspicious for a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with right portal vein tumor thrombus extending to the main portal vein through Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS 5V tumor). The appearance of the tumor was complicated by prominent perfusion anomalies within segments five and eight. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen confirmed these findings (Figure ), and the chest CT was negative for metastatic disease. Initial alpha-feta protein (AFP) was significantly elevated at 24,976.\\nNo targetable lesion was seen on ultrasound due to the infiltrative nature of the lesion and CT-guided biopsy was performed but was nondiagnostic (fibrotic benign liver tissue). Despite the lack of tissue confirmation, the consensus of the multidisciplinary liver tumor board was to treat the patient for HCC, given the radiographic appearance, gross vascular invasion and elevated AFP in the setting of underlying hepatitis C and cirrhosis. The treatment with sorafenib 400 mg PO twice daily was recommended, which was complicated by severe fatigue, anorexia, and hyponatremia necessitating hospitalization. Sorafenib was restarted at 50% dose reduction after recovery from his hospitalization. Definitive external beam radiation therapy with hypofractionated proton beam therapy was recommended given the concern for the patient\u2019s intolerance of sorafenib tolerance and the potential reduced tumor efficacy of continuing sorafenib at reduced doses. Proton therapy was chosen to limit the dose to the uninvolved normal liver and surrounding gastrointestinal organs considering the high tumor with the normal liver volume ratio. His pre-radiation AFP peaked at 37,200.\\nSince fiducial markers were not able to be placed (tumor was not visible on ultrasound) for tumor motion assessment or image guidance, the patient was CT simulated in the supine position with both arms abducted above the head using the Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC)\u2122 breath hold system (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden) in the end-exhale position at 20% of the maximal deep inhalation volume. Multiple phases (non-contrast, arterial, venous, and delayed) scans were acquired. Considering the challenges in contouring the gross tumor volume (GTV) posed by the infiltrative nature of the tumor and perfusion abnormalities on imaging, a technetium-99m [99mTc] sulfur colloid single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scan was registered to the treatment planning CT and utilized to assist in the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) as previously published by our group [-] (Figure ).\\nMargins of 5 mm were added to the GTV to create a clinical target volume (CTV) and account for tumor margin uncertainties. The CTV was also extended 10 mm medial to the furthest extent of the main portal vein tumor thrombus to account for the proximal microscopic extension. Nonisotropic margins of 5 mm radially and 8 mm superiorly/inferiorly were then applied to the CTV and GTV to generate planning target volumes (PTV1 and PTV2, respectively).\\nIntensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) with a pencil beam scanning (PBS) was utilized to deliver 45 GyE to the PTV1 and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) of an additional 22.5 GyE to the PTV2 for a total prescribed dose of 67.5 GyE in 15 daily fractions (Figure ).\\nA single right lateral beam angle was used with alternating energy layer volumetric rescanning (AELVR), an advanced technique to mitigate the interplay effect of spot scanning delivery and respiratory motion while reducing the beam delivery time to improve breath hold duty cycle (Figure ).\\nAELVR splits the original beam into odd and even layered beams so that only half the dose is delivered to the target in each beam. As the numbers of layers are cut in half, so are the number of breath holds required for each beam. Thus, AELVR allows volumetric rescanning by requiring only half the breath holds and also allows a recovery breathing time for the patient in between beams. Mean dose to the liver minus GTV was 19.0 GyE. Daily image guidance was performed with kilovoltage KV to KV imaging aligning to bony spine and for the weekly quality assurance, slow CT scans were obtained to verify liver positioning during an end-exhaled breath hold.\\nHe completed treatment with the expected side effects of mild fatigue and skin reaction. His AFP declined rapidly during treatment, reaching down to 7,800 upon completion of the treatment and subsequently normalizing to 6.6 at five months post-treatment. At this time, he developed severe chest wall pain in the irradiated area without evidence of rib fracture or tumor recurrence on imaging that required oral steroids and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control. Follow-up imaging at seven months post-treatment demonstrated a radiographically complete response in the primary tumor with evidence of post-radiation changes (Figure ). As of the last follow-up, he has not developed any clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation.",

At that time, he was diagnosed as having cirrhosis after chronic type B hepatitis and had been followed up with by the physician afterward. He was suspected to have developed HCC based on the imaging examination in December 2014, and he was referred to our hospital in March 2015 for further examination and treatment.\\nAt the time of the first visit, his consciousness was clear, but he had a flapping tremor. He presented with notable conjunctival yellowing. His abdomen was flat and soft without tenderness. Laboratory test results indicated pancytopenia, a prolonged prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, hypoalbuminemia, and jaundice. The result of the indocyanine green retention test was as high as 36.5%. The alpha-fetoprotein level was within the normal range of 2.8 ng/mL, but the protein induced by vitamin K absence/antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) level was as high as 163 mAU/mL. He had cirrhosis after chronic type B hepatitis. The nucleotide analog (entecavir) was already prescribed by the previous physician, and the serological test result was positive for hepatitis B virus DNA (Table ). Abdominal dynamic computed tomography (CT) showed that the liver edge was blunt, and the surface was irregular. A 39-mm nodule, which was enhanced in the arterial phase and slightly washed out in the equilibrium phase, was located in segment 8 of the liver. Moreover, prominent splenomegaly, collateral circulation, and a small amount of ascites in the pelvis were confirmed (Fig. ). In gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethilene-triamine-pentaacetic acid-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, the 39-mm nodule, which was enhanced in the early phase and had a low signal in the hepatocyte phase, was also observed in segment 8 of the liver. Aside from this tumor, a small nodule measuring 9 mm in diameter showed the same contrast pattern in segment 8 of the liver (Fig. ). CT during arterial portography showed perfusion defects in the 2 HCCs, and CT during arteriography showed hypervascular tumors in the early phase and peripheral enhancement in the late phase, which was consistent with typical HCC contrast patterns (Fig. ). These HCCs were enhanced simultaneously during arteriography of A8, and obvious vascular invasion was not observed (Fig. ). No other lesions suspected of HCC were found in the liver. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed high-risk esophageal varices (Lm, F2, Cb, RC-sign [+]).\\nOn the basis of these findings, we diagnosed the patient as having HCCs (cT3N0M0, clinical stage III) with severe liver damage.",

CAD was diagnosed when he had an episode of myocardial infarction 7 months ago. Subsequently, he underwent percutaneous intervention (PCI). Drug eluting stent was placed in LAD and bare metal stents were placed in D1 and D2 artery. He was on aspirin and clopidogrel (75 mg each). He remained asymptomatic subsequently. He also had hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Aspirin was stopped 2 months later in the view of repeated malaena. Preoperative echocardiogram showed EF of 42% with no pulmonary hypertension. During exercise stress echocardiogram, he achieved 90% of target HR but EF reduced from 42% to 35% and the mid-anterior septum and distal-inferior wall became akinetic. He became breathless 6 minutes after exercise and his functional capacity was rated good (METs-7, NYHA class II). Preoperative angiography revealed patent stent in LAD, blocked stent in D1 and D2 artery. Left circumflex artery was 10% blocked, while right coronary artery was 40% blocked. No further intervention was deemed necessary by cardiologist. The patient was on bisoprolol, torsemide, atorvastatin, clopidogrel and insulin. Clopidogrel was stopped 1 week prior to surgery and enoxaparin 60 mg OD was started. Airway examination was normal. Preoperative laboratory reports are summarized in .\\nEnoxaparin was stopped 12 hours prior to surgery and bisoprolol was continued. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 300 mcg, thiopentone 175 mg and intubation of trachea was facilitated with rocuronium 100 mg. Anaesthesia was maintained with 1-1.5% isoflurane in air/oxygen and fentanyl at 3 mcg/kg/h. Intraoperative monitoring and goals were same as in case 1. In addition, defibrillator pads were applied on chest. A 6 Fr sheath introducer was placed into left femoral artery for emergent establishment of intra-aortic balloon pump; however, the requirement did not arise.\\nIntraoperative haemodynamic variables are summarized in . During the later part of the dissection phase, despite high dose of noradrenalin infusion, terlipressin infusion was started to maintain MAP and SVR. IVC was partially clamped during hepatic vein reconstruction. Before reperfusion, portal flush was used to avoid post-reperfusion syndrome (PRPS). A transient fall of MAP was treated with boluses of noradrenaline, phenylephrine and soda-bicarbonate. No intraoperative ST-segment changes were detected. Total blood loss was approximately 1200 ml. The patient was shifted to liver transplant ICU and extubated 6 hours later. Antiplatelet therapy and bisoprolol were restarted 1 day after the surgery. His postoperative recovery was uneventful. Postoperative monitoring was similar to the first patient. The patient was shifted from ICU on the 8th day and discharged on the 16th postoperative day.",

Computed tomography (CT) imaging evaluation identified a single tumor with diameter approximately 3 cm located in segments V and VIII of the liver without macrovascular invasion. The tumor was staged as TNM stage T1bN0M0 Ib, corresponding to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage A. The patient had an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group Performance Score (ECOG PS) of 0, no jaundice of the skin or sclera, and negative abdominal signs. Laboratory tests revealed that the patient had normal liver function and coagulation, an AFP level 4.45 ng/mL, hepatitis B surface antigen titer of 1816, HBV DNA level of 3.45\u00d7104 IU/mL and Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) level 34 mAU/mL. Based on the single liver lesion, early stage of disease, good liver function and discussion with the patient, a hepatectomy was performed.\\nAfter a successful hepatectomy with a surgical margin of 1 cm to the tumor, pathological examination revealed the tumor had a diameter of approximately 3 cm with a negative surgical margin consisting of moderately differentiated HCC and without tumor thrombus or satellite foci. After surgery, the patient received one cycle of TACE to identify residual lesions and confirm successful resection, and no residual tumor was observed. Post-surgery, the patient received thymosin to prevent the relapse of HCC, as well as oral entecavir (500 mg/day) for the management of hepatitis B. The patient experienced tumor recurrence 14 months after surgery with a single tumor of approximately 2 cm diameter located between the left and right hepatic pedicle of the first porta hepatis. The tumor was close to the portal vein and biliary tract without macrovascular involvement. The recurrent tumor was early stage (T1aN0M0 Ia) and based on the Milan criteria the patient was a potential candidate for liver transplantation. However, the patient refused to undergo liver transplantation and underwent a CT-guided microwave ablation procedure. Post-surgery TACE revealed complete tumor ablation without residual tumor. The patient continued to receive thymosin to prevent HCC recurrence, as well as oral entecavir for hepatitis B.\\nAfter a further 11 months, the patient experienced a second recurrence characterized by multiple disseminated metastases in the left and right lobes of the liver and possible macrovascular invasion.

Rest of the physical exam was significant for cachectic appearance, jaundice, and bilateral lower extremity edema up to the knee.\\nIn the emergency room, his blood glucose was detected to be 26 mg/dL. He denied poor oral intake or history of diabetes, alcohol abuse or illicit drug use. Of note, his blood glucose level tended to be on the lower side (75-85 mg/dL) seen in the records of several outpatient visits before he lost follow-up. The blood glucose level was corrected by two immediate intravenous 50% dextrose pushes, but dropped again down to 10 mg/dL in 2 h for which continuous 10% dextrose infusion was started and the patient was instructed to consume frequent carbohydrate-rich snacks. However, recurrent hypoglycemic attacks still occurred since admission that required multiple IV 50% dextrose and glucagon pushes.\\nLaboratory evaluation of hypoglycemia showed undetectable insulin [< 0.4 \u00b5U/mL (2.6-24.9 \u00b5U/mL)], low C-peptide [0.2 ng/mL (1.1-4.4 ng/mL)], lower normal pro-insulin [1.3 pmol/L (0-10.0 pmol/L)], and undetectable beta-hydroxybutyrate [< 0.1 mg/dL (0.2-2.8 mg/dL)], excluding the possibility of insulinoma. Sulfonylurea screen test was negative. Adrenal insufficiency was also unlikely due to a high serum cortisol concentration. His hepatic function deteriorated [INR 2.8; albumin 2.9 g/dL (3.5-5.2 g/dL); total bilirubin 3.76 mg/dL (0.2-1.2 mg/dL); aspartate transaminase 145 U/L (< 40 U/L); alanine transaminase 93 U/L (< 41 U/L); alkaline phosphatase 263 U/L (40-130 U/L)]. Hepatic encephalopathy was also suspected due to high ammonia level [101 \u00b5mol/L (16-60 \u00b5mol/L)].",

        "note": "A 29-year-old man with a 55-mm tumor in segments 5 and 6 (S 5/6) of the liver was admitted to our hospital. After thorough investigations, a malignant tumor could not be ruled out, and the plan was to perform an operation on the patient. However, a month later, the CT showed a tendency for the tumor to shrink, which is suggestive of a pseudo-inflammatory tumor. Thus, we suspected that his tumor was an inflammatory pseudotumor and advised him to undergo routine follow-up CT. Two years later, he revisited our hospital with a complaint of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. We performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and noted multiple duodenal ulcers. His serum gastrin level was 2350 pg/mL (normal range: 37\u2013172 pg/mL), which was suggestive of ZES.\\nGiven that the patient was suspected of having a metastatic gastrinoma from other intra-abdominal organs, we performed several imaging studies, such as abdominal contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), SRS, and SACI test. Abdominal CT showed a 78-mm hypervascular tumor with cystic degeneration in the S 5/6 region of the liver, with a potential to increase over time (Fig. a\u2013c). The tumor showed hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging using abdominal contrast-enhanced MRI (Fig. d). On SRS, a strong accumulation was found on the hepatic tumor (Fig. e). We performed endoscopic ultrasonography, but were unable to identify any tumors in the gastrinoma triangle. We detected multiple duodenal ulcers (H1 stage) by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. f).\\nWe performed a SACI test to investigate which site secretes gastrin. The superior mesenteric artery, proximal and distal sides of the splenic artery, and the proper hepatic artery were selectively catheterized and rapidly injected with calcium gluconate. Blood samples were obtained through a catheter from the right hepatic vein (RHV) and middle hepatic vein (MHV) at the following time points: pre-injection, and at 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 s after the calcium gluconate injection. The serum gastrin concentration increased from 4620 to 23,600 pg/mL at 20 s in RHV, and from 5800 to 10,700 pg/mL at 90 s in MHV after calcium gluconate injection into the proper hepatic artery. No increase of serum gastrin levels was observed when calcium gluconate was injected into the remaining arteries (Fig. ). Therefore, we confirmed the diagnosis of \u201cprimary\u201d hepatic gastrinoma.\\nBrain and neck CT were performed to rule out multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1); however, we found no abnormalities in the pituitary or parathyroid glands. The serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, prolactin, and parathyroid hormones were normal.\\nThe tumor is in close proximity to the hilar region of the liver, especially the right branch of the portal vein, and partly involved the S4a region. Furthermore, it invades the MHV and requires combined resection of the MHV (Fig. b, c).",

        "note": "A 13-year-old boy presented in the emergency department at Nishtar hospital in 2017 with complaints of abdominal distension and upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed at that time showed bleeding at the esophageal varices. Band ligation was done to correct this. Workup at that time revealed the following investigations to be negative: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), antinuclear factor (ANF), anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti parietal cell antibodies and anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies (anti-LKM1). Serum ceruloplasmin levels were 24 mg/dl (normal 20-40 mg/dl). The slit-lamp examination did not reveal Kayser Fleischer rings. Serum iron was 32 microgram/dl (normal, 65-175), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was 184 microgram/dl (normal, 250-400), transferrin saturation 17.4% (normal range 14-50%). Ultrasound (USG) of the abdomen showed coarse liver with splenomegaly and gross ascites. Ascitic fluid examination showed high serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) ratio. There was no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). There was no history of alcohol intake, diabetes or any other co-morbid illness. After discharge, the patient did not get proper follow up for his liver disease and showed poor compliance to treatment.\\nIn June 2019, he presented to the Nishtar hospital emergency department with complaints of worsening abdominal distension and exertional dyspnea for one month and black, tarry stools for two days. He became dyspneic even while going to the washroom. Attendants also noted that in the last few weeks the patient's hands, feet and parts of face would turn blue whenever he would perform mild to moderate exertion. The patient had no history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) intake. At the time of presentation, his blood pressure (BP) was 90/50 mmHg, pulse rate 102/min and a regular, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute at rest. The patient was pale and showed grade four clubbing on examination. His fingers, tip of nose and lips were cyanosed. Abdominal examination revealed splenomegaly and gross ascites. He was conscious and oriented. However, flapping tremors were present. His oxygen saturation (spO2) in the supine position was 85% which fell to 78% when the patient sat upright in bed (orthodeoxia). It was also observed that the patient's dyspnea and tachypnea worsened on sitting forward or standing due to which the patient preferred lying supine (platypnea). Patient's management in the emergency department included intravenous resuscitation with fluids, antibiotics, dextrose, terlipressin and oxygen therapy for his hypoxemia. Initial workup revealed: hemoglobin 7g/dl (normal 13-18 g/dl), total leukocyte count 12000 /mm3 (normal 4000-11000 /mm3), platelet count 100,000 /mm3 (normal 150,000-400,000 /mm3), serum bilirubin 0.3mg/dl (normal up to 1.2 mg/dl), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 16 U/l (normal range, 10-40 U/l) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 39 U/l (normal range, 7-56 U/l), creatinine 0.8 mg/dl (normal 0.5-1.2 mg/dl), serum albumin 1.47 g/dl (normal 3.5-5.2 mg/dl), prothrombin time (PT) 15 seconds (control 12 sec), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.25.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a 55 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 56-mm mass lesion within the left frontal lobe, demonstrating an irregular rim of peripheral marginal enhancement and central cystic change (A). There was prominent surrounding white matter edema, mass effect with effacement of the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle. The patient underwent a craniotomy and complete resection, with histopathology showing microscopic appearance and immunohistochemistry consistent with gliosarcoma (E). The biopsied sample showed positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, P53, and synaptophysin, with Ki67 positive staining in up to 65% of tumor cells. There was a biphasic pattern of growth with spindle cell areas associated with reticulin deposition and loss of GFAP positivity. The sample showed negative staining for IDH1 R132H (c.395G > A) and BRAF V600E (c.1799T > A). MGMT promoter methylation was also assessed, and it was found to be unmethylated. The patient commenced 60 Gy in 30 fractions radiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) and was also enrolled in a clinical trial investigating the addition of nivolumab or placebo. Following the chemoradiation treatment, she completed one cycle of further adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ (I).\\nA follow-up MRI showed stable postoperative changes at the resection site, however a new extra-axial homogenously enhancing nodule was found at the posterosuperior margin of the craniotomy, outside the previous radiation field, measuring 12 \u00d7 7 mm (B). MRI of the spine showed no evidence of spinal metastases. Preoperative imaging 2 wk after the recurrence was initially observed showed the lesion had increased to 16 \u00d7 14 mm. The patient subsequently underwent a further craniotomy and resection, with histopathology revealing recurrent gliosarcoma (F), similarly showing a high-grade glial tumor displaying a biphasic pattern of growth. The tumor sections comprised components of pleomorphic mitotically active spindle cells, associated with reticulin deposition, which formed a meshwork intersecting islands of malignant glial forms. Further radiotherapy (30 Gy in fractions) was given postoperatively to the resection cavity.\\nOn follow-up MRI 6 mo later, two further extra-axial masses with adjacent edema of the left frontal lobe were detected measuring 20 and 11 mm, within and outside the radiotherapy field, respectively (C). She was asymptomatic of her recurrence and proceeded to further resection, with histopathology confirming further recurrent gliosarcoma (G). Interestingly there was loss of staining of GFAP in many areas of the tumor including the glial component and not just the sarcomatous component. Bizarre tumor giant cells were more conspicuous than in the previous resection specimens with atypical mitoses also noted. Postoperative MRI 6 wk later revealed further recurrent disease with a nodule in the left inferior frontal lobe measuring 17 mm, irregular nodular enhancement more superiorly involving the left frontal lobe measuring 23 mm, and irregular smaller areas of enhancement extending deep into the brain. Whole-spine MRI and CT demonstrated widespread marrow involvement of all vertebrae (D). Palliative radiotherapy of 20 Gy in five fractions was given to the C6 lesion, and the patient was referred for another clinical trial involving molecular profiling for targeted treatment. The tumor tissue from her second resection was found to have RAD51, FANCE, and CDK12 homozygous loss. She was therefore commenced on a PARP inhibitor in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy on a clinical trial. A biopsy of the right iliac bone was also performed, with histopathology revealing morphological features similar to the previously resected gliosarcoma (H). Immunohistochemistry was also consistent with gliosarcoma; the sample showed positive staining for vimentin in all components and selective positivity for GFAP with strong positive staining of tumor cells in a viable hypercellular focus and lack of staining of dispersed atypical spindled cells in adjacent collagenous stroma.\\nOne week after completing her palliative radiotherapy, she was admitted to hospital with hypercalcemia and treated with intravenous fluid rehydration and zoledronic acid.",

He had experienced difficulty in walking for 3 months prior followed by diffuse bone pain in his whole body and weight loss for 2 months. He had 6 brothers and 1 sister; one of his brothers had been treated for spinal tuberculosis 9 years earlier. He was managed with analgesics and proton pump inhibitors. A skeletal survey () revealed osteolytic lesions in multiple long and flat bones. Bone scintigraphy with technetium-99 showed high accumulation in the skull, vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, both humeri, and the bilateral femurs (). A whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan () revealed multiple metabolically active lytic lesions all over the skeletal system. No other metabolically active lesions were observed. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, and prostate-specific antigen levels were normal; the patient's thyroid profile was also normal. The patient was then referred to the hematology department. There was no history of pallor, bleeding, arthralgia or arthritis, nor any history of blood transfusion. On examination, there was mild pallor, but no icterus, pedal edema, or palpable lymph nodes. The liver and spleen were not palpable, but bony tenderness was present. The patient was afebrile and his vital signs were stable. The results of hematologic tests were as follows: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, red blood cell (RBC) count 4.28\u00d71012/L, white blood cell count 11.3\u00d7109/L, and platelet count 468\u00d7109/L.

This pain persisted until she went to bed. Upon awakening, she still had the discomfort, therefore, sought medical attention the next morning. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation for which she had been on apixaban and flecainide. The patient had noninvasive cardiac studies done within the last few months which had not suggested ischemic coronary artery disease.\\nOn presentation, her vitals were: temperature 96.2 F, blood pressure 185/74 mm Hg, heart rate 66 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. An EKG showed sinus rhythm at 74 bpm, QRS duration was 96 milliseconds (ms) with a prolonged QT interval with the corrected interval (QTc) of 641 ms ().

        "note": "A 35-year-old male with end-stage renal disease of unknown cause underwent cadaveric renal transplantation in our department 6 years ago. Due to a lack of kidney biopsy, we did not know the exact etiology causing him to develop an end-stage renal disease. The postoperative immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. The patient was followed at another clinic at approximately 8-month intervals. There was no obvious abnormality except for medium microscopic haematuria for his latest follow-up. Unfortunately, the doctor in that clinic did not recommend further examination, so we had no idea about the source or morphology of the red blood cells in urine. The patient did not have a history of hypertension, diabetes or hyperparathyroidism. He had a desk job, so he might have been too sedentary. He did not have a bad lifestyle, such as drinking alcohol or smoking, except for drinking Coca-Cola (1 can per day) for 3 to 4 years. On the 6th year after transplantation, the patient suddenly fevered with a temperature of 38.8 \u00b0C and shiver, accompanied by oliguria with 400\u2013500 mL urine/d and little gross haematuria. He was admitted to emergency department. Physical examination indicated a heart rate (HR) of 92 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 131/88 mmHg, Body Mass Index (BMI) of 27.5 kg/m2, and mild tenderness in the graft area. Blood chemical test showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.37 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocytes 11%, neutrophils 79%, serum creatinine 4.04 mg/dL, blood glucose 109.8 mg/dL, serum uric acid 6.4 mg/dL, blood calcium 8.90 mg/dL, serum albumin 2.73 g/dL. The pH value of the urine was 6.2. Computerized tomography (CT) showed that there was a stone with a size of 18 mm in the ureteropelvic junction, which caused mild hydronephrosis (Fig. ). An emergent operation was arranged in combination with efficient antimicrobial therapy. A ureteroscope (URS) was performed in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia. We could not insert the guide wire into the new orifice with a 70\u00b0 lens ureteroscope, although we switched to a semirigid ureteroscope. Therefore, we had to perform percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) to remove the stones. The anterior calyx in the upper pole was chosen for puncture under ultrasonography guidance. An nephroscope was inserted through the sheath to inspect the pelvicalyceal system, and a 9.5\u201310 Fr flexible URS was used to inspect the ureter. A brown stone of 18 mm was located in the ureteropelvic junction. The stone was fragmented and extracted. After the stone was confirmed free by intraoperative ultrasonography, a 4.8 Fr double-pigtail stent was introduced. A 14 Fr nephrostomy tube was placed. After operation, the patient\u2019s condition improved quickly, with normal temperature and gradually increased urine (2300 mL urine/day), and serum creatinine decreased to 1.65 mg/dL. The nephrostomy tube was removed 3 days later. The patient was discharged 10 days postoperation with normal urine and serum creatinine, and a stone-free condition was confirmed by ultrasonography. A double-pigtail stent was removed 4 weeks later. After discharge, the patient was followed up every 3 months and then every 6 months 1 year later. There were no abnormalities during follow-up. Unexpectedly, the patient was admitted to the hospital again 16 months after the operation for similar symptoms, including fever (39 \u00b0C), shivers, and anuria, but without pain. Blood chemical tests indicated severe infection and ARF (WBC 8.14 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocytes 11.2%, neutrophils 84.2%, and serum creatine 6.68 mg/dL), blood glucose was 113.4 mg/dL, serum uric acid was 6.6 mg/dL, blood calcium was 8.82 mg/dL, serum albumin was 2.55 g/dL.",

        "note": "A 13-year-old, previously fit and well, male presented with pain and swelling to his right lower leg. A bone cyst was identified on imaging including plain radiographs and MRI scans (Figures and ). He underwent curettage on three occasions, including one with a bone graft, with recurrence on each occasion. An ABC was confirmed on biopsy on tissue obtained during curettage. En bloc resection of the proximal tibia was not thought to be viable due to the extent of disease and involvement of major neurovascular structures. Vascular embolization was not possible because no feeding vessels were identified on angiogram. Throughout this period, he had ongoing severe leg pain, was unable to weight-bear or attend school, and was at significant risk of pathological fracture.\\nDenosumab therapy was subsequently commenced following discussion of a bone tumour treatment multidisciplinary team. The weight at the start of treatment was 36 kg, with a height of 161 cm. The patient received four doses of subcutaneous denosumab (70 mg/m2) on a weekly basis for four weeks with significant improvement in pain, allowing him to return to school shortly after, although he was still immobile. There was a subtle initial radiological response with a slight reduction in size of the lesion. There was asymptomatic mild hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium 2.03 mmol/L; normal range 2.25\u20132.74 mmol/L) in the early stages of treatment which was treated with oral calcium supplementation (calcium carbonate 1.25 g daily). He remained on this supplementation throughout treatment. The patient went on to receive six further doses of denosumab at four-week intervals at the same dose.\\nOn review following six months of treatment, there was ongoing radiological improvement, with bony consolidation (). The patient remained pain free, and he began partial weight-bearing over the subsequent few months. However, there was also evidence of some calcification of the lower limb growth plates, possibly as a result of denosumab therapy. Therefore, the dose interval was increased initially to two months, and then at 12 months of treatment, to three months.\\nAfter 18 months of treatment, the patient was walking without protection and fully weight-bearing without pain. The ABC was stable radiologically, and the dosing interval was further increased to four months.\\nOn review after 27 months of treatment (following the 17th dose; cumulative dose 1554 mg), the patient remained pain free and was able to play gentle sport. Given the good response, the plan was for two further doses of denosumab every six months before stopping therapy.\\nOn presentation for the first six-month dose, the patient was found to have a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg. He reported he had felt generally unwell for several weeks with malaise, anorexia, polyuria, and headaches. His weight was 47 kg which was significantly lower than his last clinic review four months earlier when it was 50.7 kg, demonstrating a weight loss of 3.7 kg. Height was static in this four-month period at 172 cm. Initial blood tests demonstrated hypercalcaemia (corrected calcium 4.04 mmol/L). There were normal levels of phosphate (1.35 mmol/L; normal range 0.74\u20131.55 mmol/L) and alkaline phosphatase (201\u00b5/L; normal range 55\u2013236\u00b5/L). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 was <5 nmol/L, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 84 nmol/L (normal range >50 nmol/L). In addition, there was an acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 293 \u00b5mol/L (normal range 46\u2013102 \u00b5mol/L) and a urea of 13.4 mmol/L (normal range 2.5\u20136.7 mmol/L). His parathyroid hormone level on presentation was suppressed at 1.0 pmol/L (normal range 1.1\u20136.9 pmol/L). Urine calcium/creatinine ratio was high at 3.62 mm/mm Cr (normal range 0\u20130.6 mm/mm Cr), however was not performed until 11 days after presentation and initial management. Lab values on this presentation and in subsequent management are summarised in .\\nInitial management was with intravenous (IV) fluids, IV furosemide (60 mg six hourly), and cessation of the supplemental calcium. There was no initial biochemical improvement, with corrected calcium peaking at 4.18 mmol/L and creatinine at 314 \u00b5mol/L. 200 units of calcitonin, initially subcutaneously, and then intravenously, was introduced once a day with limited improvement in calcium level and renal function, despite increasing to twice daily dosing over a nine-day period. Therefore, two doses of IV pamidronate (0.25 mg/kg and then 0.5 mg/kg, 24 hours apart) were given. Bisphosphonate therapy led to the normalisation of calcium levels within three days, with subsequent improvement to normal range of the high creatinine (97 \u00b5mol/L) a further three days later.",

        "note": "An 18-year-old male received the 1st cycle of intensive chemotherapy for Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma and developed massive tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), the diagnosis confirmed by laboratory as well as clinical criteria, and developed multiple electrolyte disturbances, in particular a very high and rising serum phosphorus level that was difficult to control and posed an immediate danger to life. Lactate dehydrogenase peaked at 9,105 U/L (reference: 130 \u2013 250) and was accompanied by acute kidney injury (AKI) with a serum creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL by the 4th day along with oliguria (< 400 mL/day), hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L), extreme hyperphosphatemia (21.4 mg/dL), hypermagnesemia (3.1 mg/dL), and hypocalcemia. The decision was made to initiate urgent renal replacement therapy based on life-threatening electrolyte disturbances. We utilized an initial session of conventional intermittent hemodialysis (iHD) to control the marked elevation of phosphate, followed by continuous hemodialysis to address the continued release of phosphorus from cell lysis of hematologic malignancy. The initial iHD was a 4-hour session with a blood flow of 200 mL/min and dialysate flow of 400 mL/min with the electrolyte composition of sodium 150 mEq/L and calcium 2.5 mE/L. Additionally, in our case, we utilized a simultaneous mannitol administration of 12.5 g at 2 and 4 hours after the start of hemodialysis to ensure the stability of serum osmolality and prevent potential for dialysis-related disequilibrium syndrome. The serum phosphate improved to 8.7 mg/dL; thereafter, high-volume slow continuous hemofiltration commenced. The initial hemofiltration rate was 30 mL/kg/hour (2 L/h), however the serum phosphate was difficult to control and even rose temporarily within the next 24 hours (13 and 11 mg/dL, respectively), so the rate of hemofiltration was subsequently escalated to 3.5 L/h. The patient showed excellent tolerance for these therapies and eventually recovered renal function as demonstrated during follow-up visits (serum creatinine 0.7 mg/dL).\\nTLS is the logical sequela of the rapid lysis of cells found in rapidly growing malignancies, which overwhelm the homeostatic capabilities of the organism. Hyperphosphatemia directly decreases proximal tubular phosphate absorption via NPi 1a and 1c cotransporters which, in turn increases the excretion of phosphate. Phosphatonins also decrease phosphate reabsorption by suppressing the luminal expression of sodium-phosphate cotransporters [].\\nHyperphosphatemia is known to contribute significantly to the development and maintenance of anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis. Most clinicians learned the mnemonic GOLD PARRK to include hyperphosphatemia as a cause of high AG acidosis, (G for glycols, O for 5-oxoproline, L for lactic acidosis, D for D-lactic acidosis, P for hyperphosphatemia, A for alcohols and acetyl salicylic acid, R for renal failure and rhabdomyolysis, and K for ketoacidosis) [, ]. The cellular toxicity from hyperphosphatemia can lead to the clinical catastrophe of hyperphosphatemic and hypocalcemic coma and has been documented as a cause of rapidly fatal respiratory failure [].\\nGenerally, hyperphosphatemia does not frequently necessitate acute treatment in situations where the renal function is well preserved. There is not much guidance in the literature for the management of hyperphosphatemia in the absence of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The treatment of acute phosphate nephropathy usually targets improving the excretion of phosphate from the body, either by volume expansion, administration of phosphate binders, or ultimately renal replacement therapy. High serum uric acid levels, on the other hand, can cause endothelial dysfunction via chemokine mechanisms that involve the formation of oxygen free radicals and the activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Additional mechanisms for renal injury from hyperuricemia in TLS include tubular deposition and subsequent intratubular obstruction. This downward spiral has been shown to lead to failure of renal arterial autoregulation, vasoconstriction as well as decrease in single nephron glomerular filtration rate [, ].\\nThe identification, monitoring and intervention of at-risk patients for TLS follows follow a schematic from the guidelines.\\nA 2008 international expert panel on TLS recommended that both children and adults at any risk for TLS initially receive 2 \u2013 3 L/m2 per day of IV fluid. There are no specific guidelines for the type of fluid or duration, which should depend on clinical discretion []. For adult and pediatric patients with intermediate-risk TLS which include highly chemotherapy-sensitive solid tumors, allopurinol is recommended. Rasburicase is recommended for the initial management of most adult and pediatric patients with high-risk disease. Patients who develop TLS should be monitored in the intensive care unit, assessed for urgent dialysis, and rasburicase continued at 0.2 mg/kg []. Furthermore, indications for renal replacement therapy follow the general guidelines for the treatment of AKI and its complications. As in our case, it is probable that the likelihood of renal complete recovery is good if renal replacement therapy is initiated early.\\nWhen our patient developed TLS, which we defined by the classic laboratory criteria and the clinical criteria, we proceeded to dialyze based on massive hyperphosphatemia (21.4 mg/dL), hypocalcemia with calcium-phosphate product of 149.8, hyperkalemia (6.2 mM/L), in the overall context of acute renal failure (serum creatinine > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) and oliguria (< 400 mL/day).",

She had no history of either diagnosis of or treatment for diabetes, but hemoglobin (Hb)A1c had been recorded as 6.8% about 1 year before this presentation. She had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for about 1 year, due to exacerbations of both depression and Alzheimer-type dementia that had developed 10 years earlier and 12 years earlier, respectively. About 2 months before presentation, her dietary intake decreased and infusion of glucose, electrolytes and water was started. She had been in a bedridden state with no speech and almost no appetite from about 1 month before presentation. At that point, hyperglycemia and hypernatremia were inferred to have already been present for a long time. Two days before presentation, sudden high fever (38 \u00b0C) and involuntary movements of the trunk and upper limbs appeared. One day later, she entered a coma. A blood glucose level (BG) of 1000 mg/dL and a serum sodium (Na) level of 179 mmol/L (glucose-corrected Na level: 194 mmol/L) were confirmed, and the patient was referred to our department for emergency hospitalization.\\nGlasgow coma scale score was 3 (eye opening, 1; best verbal response, 1; best motor response, 1), the pupils were 3 mm on both sides, and light reflex was rather dull, accompanied by involuntary movements of the whole body. Body temperature was 37.6 \u00b0C, blood pressure was 57/40 mmHg, heart rate was 114 beats/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation was maintained at 95% under mask administration of oxygen at 10 L/min. The tongue was very dry, and turgor of the skin was low. No abnormalities were observed in other physical findings except for the presence of moist rales at the end of inspiration in bilateral lower lung fields. Drugs being administered were limaprost alfadex at 5 mg/day, furosemide at 10 mg/day, and paroxetine at 5 mg/day.\\nResults of blood and biochemical examinations and blood gas analysis are shown in Table . Negative results were obtained for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (< 5.0 U/mL) (Table ). Computed tomography of the chest showed infiltrative shadows in both lower lung fields (image not shown). This patient with hyperglycemia, dehydration, malnutrition, and potential thrombus formation during long-term bed rest was suspected to have developed into HHS and ketosis due to progression of hyperglycemia and dehydration caused by pneumonia. Furthermore, ketoacidosis had developed from ketosis and prerenal renal failure associated with circulating hypovolemia shock, which was also associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\\nTreatment was started with intravenous infusion of fast-acting insulin (Humalin R; Eli Lilly, Kobe, Japan) (starting at 4 units/h and gradually decreasing) and low-sodium replacement fluid []. In the first 24 h, 6000 mL of replacement fluid (95.8 g of glucose, 0.3% Na) was added, and 2000 mL of replacement fluid (20.8 g of glucose, 0.2% Na) was administered within the period of 24\u201348 h. At 48\u201372 h, 1000 mL of replacement solution (75 g of glucose, 0.1% Na) was administered, and combined use of tube feeding was started (Fig. ). Correction of K was performed appropriately.

        "note": "A 44-year-old homeless male patient with unclear past medical history at admission was brought in by ambulance for sudden onset of intractable non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting associated with altered mental status. A fingerstick glucose screening upon admission revealed a blood glucose of >600 mg/dL. His blood pressure was 163/83 mmHg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical examination was remarkable for a thin physique, altered sensorium, but responsive to verbal and tactile stimuli and incoherent speech. The rest of the physical examination was benign except for pinpoint pupils.\\nInitial laboratory data revealed a blood sugar of 875 mg/dL, pH of 7.27, lactate of 3.8 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 13 mEq/L, partial pressure of CO2 of 43 mmHg, sodium of 147 mEq/L (corrected sodium of 159 mEq/L), potassium of 5.1 mEq/L, chloride of 93 mEq/L, anion gap of 41 and large blood and urine ketones were detected. Additionally, the patient had an elevated BUN/creatinine of 56/2.0 mg/dL suggestive of acute kidney injury from likely pre-renal cause and urine toxicology positive for opiates, cocaine, and methadone. Due to the acuity of his altered sensorium, a head CT was ordered and revealed an old left middle cerebral artery infarction. The initial acid-base analysis revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, mild respiratory acidosis from possible lack of optimal respiratory compensation due to suppression of the respiratory drive caused by opioid intoxication, and a delta-delta gap more than two suggestive of metabolic alkalosis from the recurrent vomiting (Table ).\\nThe patient initially received 2 liters of 0.9% saline solution. Electrolytes repeated after three hours, revealed an increase of corrected sodium from 159 mEq/L to 162 mEq/L. The fluid choice was changed to Ringer\u2019s Lactate (LR) infusion at 200 mL/hour, and 10 units bolus of regular insulin was given and continued with insulin intravenous infusion at 5.5 units/hours adjusted at his weight (55 kg). Subsequent evaluation of electrolytes revealed a steady-state of the corrected serum sodium at 156-158 mEq/L between hour 6 to hour 20 since the first serum sodium obtained at admission.\\nOnce the blood glucose was close to 200 mg/dL, we decided to change the fluids from LR to dextrose 5% (D5W) to initiate the correction of sodium at a rate of approximately 0.5 mEq/L/hour.",

There was no associated fever, diarrheal illness, respiratory symptoms, morning headache with vomiting, or focal neurological deficit prior to the development of fits. There was no history of trauma to head. He did not have any chronic illness or fits in the past, did not undergo any surgeries, and was not on any medications. There was no family history of cardiovascular events or epilepsy. He is a nonsmoker and has not consumed alcohol. He was not an illicit drug abuser.\\nFollowing admission, patient remained drowsy with only a mild improvement of conscious level following the seizure.\\nOn examination, his body mass index was 27 kg/m2 (height, 1.65 cm; weight, 73.5 kg). He had a puffy face with significant periorbital swelling and bilateral nonpitting ankle edema. His skin was dry and coarse. Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy or goiter. His body temperature was 36\u00b0C. Vital parameters revealed a heart rate of 45 beats/min, blood pressure of 140/100 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 12 cycles/min with an oxygen saturation of 94% on air. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 10/15 on admission which had improved to 12/15 with persisting drowsiness. He did not have any evidence of external injuries. There was no neck stiffness or detectable focal limb weakness. His ankle jerk was slow relaxing, planta response was flexor, and his fundi were normal. Examination of the respiratory system and abdomen was normal.\\nFollowing the clinical evaluation, meningoencephalitis, intracranial space occupying lesion, myxedema, metabolic encephalopathy, and toxin induced disease were taken as differential diagnoses. Preceding memory disturbances, facial puffiness, dry skin, hypothermia, bradycardia, low respiratory rate, and slow relaxing reflexes were supportive of the diagnosis of myxedema.\\nBasic investigations revealed, haemoglobin, 10.5 g/dL, with macrocytosis, normal white cell count, and normal inflammatory markers. His random blood sugar was 85 mg/dL, liver profile revealed AST of 50 U/L (<20), ALT of 65 U/L (<17), and serum creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (0.8\u20131.2). Noncontrast computed tomography of the brain was normal excluding the possibility of intracranial lesion. Electroencephalogram revealed diffuse slow waves and was suggestive of metabolic encephalopathy. Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with small QRS complexes. ST segments were depressed and T waves showed inverted pattern in all the leads. Echocardiogram showed a mild-to-moderate amount of pericardial effusion with good left ventricular functions but had no evidence of cardiac tamponade. In addition, his creatinine kinase (CK) value was 455 U/L (24\u2013195). Septic screening was negative.\\nHis serum sodium level (Na+) was 125 mmol/L and potassium was 4.0 mmol/L. Further evaluation revealed a low serum osmolality (260 mOsm/L) with a urinary osmolality of 426 mOsm/L and urinary sodium excretion of 54 mmol/L. His random cortisol level prior to initiating treatment was 560 nmol/L and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxin level (fT4) were >100 mU/L (0.4\u20134) and 0.32 ng/dL (0.9\u20131.7), respectively. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed to exclude the possibility of meningoencephalitis and CSF results were normal.\\nDiagnosis of myxedema was made on clinical as well as biochemical evidence. In addition to the very high TSH and low fT4 levels, patient had macrocytic anaemia, mild pericardial effusion on echocardiography, hyponatraemia in the background of normal hydration status, elevated liver enzymes, and high CK value in support of the above diagnosis. It was further supported by the high total cholesterol level of 310 mg/dL (<200 mg/dL) found on subsequent evaluation. A definitive precipitation factor was not identified in our patient.\\nAs the possible causes for the presentation with fits and persistent drowsiness, hyponatraemia and/or myxedema were considered. Our patient had moderate degree of hyponatraemia (125\u2013129 mmol/L). Although overt neurological symptoms are seen in severe hyponatraemia (<125 mmol/L), especially when the Na+ < 115 mmol/L [], as the patient was having persistent drowsiness, he was initially managed with Na+ correction. He was given one bolus of 3% NaCl 100 ml over 20 min on admission following which his GCS had improved to 13/15. Thereafter, hyponatraemia was managed with fluid restriction.",

It could have been caused by the increase in the negative charge for albumin and enhanced production of lactate seen in metabolic alkalosis []. Conversely, it is also possible that scant ketones, which are produced in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, as seen by mildly elevated \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and the absence of ketones in the urine, could have contributed to the elevated anion gap [].\\nAdditionally, the patient had hypernatremia.",

There was evidence of insulin resistance with fasting insulin 336 pmol/L (10\u201380), C-peptide 1180 pmol/L (350\u2013750), and clinical acanthosis nigricans. Insulin autoantibodies were negative. She had moderate, unexplained intellectual disability with some subtle dysmorphic facial features. There was an extensive family history of T2DM (Figure ). Initial treatment consisted of insulin up to 3 units/kg/day. A microarray study (Agilent ISCA (v2) 60 K whole genome array) demonstrated a novel 1.3 Mb deletion at chromosome 17q12, this segment includes the HNF1\u03b2 and multiple other genes. Thus, there is a haplo-insufficiency of HNF1\u03b2. Parental studies were normal, showing this to be a de novo deletion. Mutation within the HNF1\u03b2 gene may cause urogenital abnormalities as well as MODY, but renal and pelvic ultrasonography were normal. The intellectual disability and subtle facial dysmorphism may also be due to the loss of other genes within this deleted segment. Currently her HbA1c is 48 nmmol/mol (6.5%) on insulin 1.25 units/kg/day and 500 mg TDS Metformin.",

She had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for about 1 year, due to exacerbations of both depression and Alzheimer-type dementia that had developed 10 years earlier and 12 years earlier, respectively. About 2 months before presentation, her dietary intake decreased and infusion of glucose, electrolytes and water was started. She had been in a bedridden state with no speech and almost no appetite from about 1 month before presentation. At that point, hyperglycemia and hypernatremia were inferred to have already been present for a long time. Two days before presentation, sudden high fever (38 \u00b0C) and involuntary movements of the trunk and upper limbs appeared. One day later, she entered a coma. A blood glucose level (BG) of 1000 mg/dL and a serum sodium (Na) level of 179 mmol/L (glucose-corrected Na level: 194 mmol/L) were confirmed, and the patient was referred to our department for emergency hospitalization.\\nGlasgow coma scale score was 3 (eye opening, 1; best verbal response, 1; best motor response, 1), the pupils were 3 mm on both sides, and light reflex was rather dull, accompanied by involuntary movements of the whole body.

She had no history of either diagnosis of or treatment for diabetes, but hemoglobin (Hb)A1c had been recorded as 6.8% about 1 year before this presentation. She had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for about 1 year, due to exacerbations of both depression and Alzheimer-type dementia that had developed 10 years earlier and 12 years earlier, respectively. About 2 months before presentation, her dietary intake decreased and infusion of glucose, electrolytes and water was started. She had been in a bedridden state with no speech and almost no appetite from about 1 month before presentation. At that point, hyperglycemia and hypernatremia were inferred to have already been present for a long time. Two days before presentation, sudden high fever (38 \u00b0C) and involuntary movements of the trunk and upper limbs appeared. One day later, she entered a coma. A blood glucose level (BG) of 1000 mg/dL and a serum sodium (Na) level of 179 mmol/L (glucose-corrected Na level: 194 mmol/L) were confirmed, and the patient was referred to our department for emergency hospitalization.\\nGlasgow coma scale score was 3 (eye opening, 1; best verbal response, 1; best motor response, 1), the pupils were 3 mm on both sides, and light reflex was rather dull, accompanied by involuntary movements of the whole body. Body temperature was 37.6 \u00b0C, blood pressure was 57/40 mmHg, heart rate was 114 beats/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation was maintained at 95% under mask administration of oxygen at 10 L/min. The tongue was very dry, and turgor of the skin was low. No abnormalities were observed in other physical findings except for the presence of moist rales at the end of inspiration in bilateral lower lung fields. Drugs being administered were limaprost alfadex at 5 mg/day, furosemide at 10 mg/day, and paroxetine at 5 mg/day.\\nResults of blood and biochemical examinations and blood gas analysis are shown in Table .

        "note": "A 53 year old Pakistani lady presented to the Medicine clinic of a local hospital in 2004 with a history of heel pain and lower back pain for 5 months. In this period, the patient had sustained a rib fracture and left humeral fracture. There was no history of diabetes, hypertension or any other chronic disease. She had not been on any form of medication, including steroids and traditional drugs widely available and prescribed in the region, prior to the onset of pain. At the time of the fractures, she had been placed on non steroidal anti inflammatory agents, acetaminophen and tramadol. There was no history of illicit drug use and she was a non smoker. Family history was unremarkable, particularly in the context of bone disease, and malignancy.\\nInitial laboratory investigations had shown a mildly elevated total calcium level of 10.8 mg/dL {2.7 mmol/L}-(no albumin level result available from that time for correction). Parathormone levels (PTH) had not been determined. There was no vitamin d or renal function report available from that time. X-Ray pelvis revealed lytic lesions in the right iliac bone (Fig. ). A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine showed some signal changes. The differentials based on the MRI were metastatic bone disease or multiple myeloma.\\nSerum protein electrophoresis was normal. The patient then got lost to follow-up. Her work up was resumed 4 years later when her bone pains had started flaring up. Bone marrow examinations done back in 2007, and later in 2009, were negative for multiple myeloma. A bone scan in November 2009 showed generalized increased tracer uptake over the skull and both the axial and appendicular skeletons- findings in favor of metabolic bone disease (Fig. a). An initial planar parathyroid sestamibi scan requested by a general practitioner in November 2009 was negative for any functioning parathyroid adenoma in the neck or superior mediastinum. No serum PTH report was available from this time either. Following this workup, the patient was treated empirically for bone pains with calcium supplements, an empiric vitamin d injection, and intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg (without prior bone mineral density assessment via DXA scan). This empiric treatment was instituted by an orthopedic surgeon whom she had been referred to. The patient experienced only a slight improvement in bone pains with this treatment and also developed nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Subsequently, she sought care at the National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Dow University Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.\\nAt presentation, the patient was well oriented and of functional class 3 (wheel chair bound, able to walk only with support). Her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. Neck examination revealed no mass or lymphadenopathy. She had a significant proximal myopathy as well as curved thighs. She had shortened fingers, and spinal scoliosis was evident. Severe generalized bone tenderness was elicited. There was no focal deficit. Laboratory investigations at this time showed a calcium level of 15.1 mg/dL{3.775 mmol/L}, (corrected for albumin of 3.6 mg/dL{36 g/L}); Vitamin D3 level of 33.92 ng/mL{84.664 nmol/L}; phosphorus 2.3 mg/dL {0.743 mmol/L}and alkaline phosphatase of 1298 IU/L {21.633 \u00b5kat/L}. Her 24 h urine calcium was 155 mg/day {3.875 mmol/day}, with urine calcium to creatinine ratio of 0.02. Her creatinine level was 1.3 mg/dL {114.92 \u00b5mol/L}(Table ).",

        "note": "A 64-year-old male presented with gross hematuria. His past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, erectile dysfunction, and surgery for diverticulosis. Recent investigations revealed a creatinine level of 104 \u00b5mol/L and a glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. A computerized tomography urogram revealed a right-to-left CFRE, which roughly approximated a horseshoe kidney (Figure ). The urogram also identified a filling defect in the left upper pole of the fused kidney (Figure ). The renal tissue was biopsied using videoscopic ureteroscopy and pathology identified a high-grade pTa lesion. Given the stage and location of the lesion, the chosen treatment was nephrectomy of the left moiety with ureterectomy and bladder cuff excision.\\nThe patient was positioned in the supine position with exposure of both the lower abdomen and the penis. A flexible cystoscope was introduced via the urethra and ureteral stents were placed inside both the left and right moieties of the kidney, allowing for accurate differentiation of the two collecting systems. Next, a large midline incision was made from the umbilicus to the pubic symphysis. The descending colon and small intestine were then mobilized and reflected to expose the fused kidney and the left renal vein.\\nTwo branches from the left renal vein to the kidney were identified: one extending to the left moiety and the other to the right moiety. The left renal artery was then identified posterior to the renal vein. Accessory arterial branches were dissected, and ligation was placed just distal to the single branch supplying the right moiety of the kidney. The veins corresponding to the left moiety were then ligated and dissected. Finally, the portion of the artery distal to the ligation was dissected, providing full control of the left moiety vasculature. Next, the kidney was skeletonized until a clear area of demarcation emerged between the vasculature of the two moieties. Pressure was applied to the isthmus separating the two moieties to achieve reasonable hemostasis, and a sharp incision was made to release the left moiety from the right. Blood loss at this stage was minimal, as both gross and parenchymal bleeding were quickly controlled.\\nUreterectomy and bladder cuff excision were subsequently performed without any difficulties. Upon reassessment of the kidney, there was no evidence of bleeding in the hilum and the remaining moiety appeared to be well-perfused. A node dissection was briefly considered but was ultimately not performed given the complexity of the vasculature and the risk to the remaining portion of the kidney. Overall, the surgery was completed without complications and the estimated blood loss was 1400 mL.\\nThe final pathology revealed a high-grade T3 papillary urothelial carcinoma with negative margins. On gross examination, the tumor appeared to invade through the renal calyces into the parenchyma. The lesion was located more than 2.5 cm from the renal vein and did not appear to extend into the renal sinus fat. Microscopic evaluation revealed no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.\\nPostoperatively, the patient recovered well despite the size and complexity of the surgery. In the weeks following the operation, he developed left-sided testicular pain and swelling consistent with epididymitis. The presumed infection was treated with ciprofloxacin. A scrotal ultrasound was also performed to confirm the benignity of the testicular symptoms. Postoperative investigations revealed a glomerular filtration rate of 46 mL/min/1.73 m2 (at 40 days).",

        "note": "This previously healthy 3-year-old boy presented with renal failure, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and hypertension in the absence of a preceding diarrhoeal illness. The diagnosis of aHUS was confirmed by renal biopsy, which showed diffuse glomerular basement membrane thickening and splitting with subendothelial fibrinoid deposition. Endothelium swelling associated with wall thickening in some arteries was also visible. Neither glomerulosclerosis nor tubular atrophy was observed. The clinical evolution is outlined in Fig. . Dialysis (initially hemodialysis and subsequently peritoneal dialysis) was started because of salt and water retention. The patient was never anuric, and the maximum plasma creatinine level was 270 \u00b5mol/L. Dialysis was stopped after 2 months when the plasma creatinine was 110 \u00b5mol/L. Two weeks after presentation, the patient developed seizures secondary to malignant hypertension and was admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit where daily PE was commenced (40 ml/kg per session of fresh frozen plasma). After a further 2 weeks, his clinical condition improved, his platelet count normalized and plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) stabilized at slightly increased levels. Eight weeks after presentation, he was transferred to our centre for creation of an arterio-venous shunt and chronic prophylactic PE. The frequency of PE was reduced to three times a week until the plasma creatinine level returned to 47 \u00b5mol/L (calculated creatinine clearance according to Schwartz: 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2) 5 months after presentation. The frequency of PE was then reduced to twice weekly and then to once a week thereafter. Of note, the plasma LDH values never normalized completely. The plasma concentration of the complement factors C3, C3d, C4, Factor B, AP 50 and CH 50 were normal and remained so throughout the course of his illness. Growth retardation was present until renal transplantation. Hypertension was difficult to control until the introduction of AII receptors blockers 6 months after presentation. For the next 24 months, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria and blood pressure remained normal, and no hospitalization was needed. There were many short episodes of absence which were treated satisfactory with valproic acid and lamotrigine. Computed tomography scanning showed no cerebral lesions. During the third year after presentation, the plasma creatinine level rose progressively from normal values to 127 \u00b5mol/L. At the same time proteinuria developed (1.1 g/24 h) and the blood pressure increased.",

Symptomatology evolved in a context of progressive deterioration of the general state and poor general condition. Upon physical examination, he appeared weak (stage II of WHO score), with a body temperature of 36.2\u00b0C. His lungs, heart, and abdomen were normal. Chest CT scans showed a large mass in the right lower lobe with spiculated contours that measured 110 mm. The mass was associated with latero-tracheal, anterior mediastinal, and right hilar lymphadenopathy. Further staging showed multiple lesions of the spine (D8), right sacroiliac joint, 4th right odds. However, no visceral lesion was observed after abdominal ultrasonographic examination. Using a scan-guided biopsy, histological and immunohistochemical evidences supported a sarcomatoid carcinoma, with carcinomatous proliferation of pleomorphic spindle and globoid cells []. Tumor cells were positive for vimentin [], cytokeratin, and TTF1 []. They did not express cytokeratins 7, 20, or 5/6. In addition, they did not express p63. The patient received cisplatin and navelbine, with a partial response after the third cycle (70 mm versus 110 mm). We decided to continue the same chemotherapy after the good clinical and radiological response; however, the patient presented with an acute kidney injury after the fourth cycle.",

Glycogen storage disease type Ia was diagnosed during infancy (fasting hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly), and confirmed by molecular diagnosis (compound heterozygosity for both c.527A>G and c.1039 C>T mutations in the glucose 6 phosphatase gene).\\nThis patient also has both Willebrand and Gilbert diseases. He had been treated with growth hormone at 12 years of age, for 1 year, for retarded growth, with no clinical improvement. He had been an active smoker since the age of 15 years, and recently quit smoking.\\nHe used to have chronic metabolic imbalance during the second decade of life. Supplementations with uncooked cornstarch since infancy, then enteral nutrition by the age of 17 were not well tolerated because of chronic diarrhea. Blood tests performed at 22 were disturbed as follow: triglyceridemia 19 mmoL/L, uricemia 0.498 mmoL/L, bicarbonate 16 mmoL/L, lactic acid before breakfast 9 mmoL/L. The patient slowly developed hepatic polyadenomatosis. He also developed osteoporosis.\\nWhen he was 22 years old, uncooked cornstarch (300-420 g/day) was replaced by Glycosade and oral fenofibrate was started. His diet was hyperglucidic, glucides representing 63% of caloric intake. This treatment allowed an improvement of metabolic balance. His metabolic blood tests between 22 and 25 years of age were as follow: triglyceridemia between 2.28 and 4.56 mmoL/L, uricemia between 0.4 and 0.5 mmoL/L, lactic acid before breakfast between 3 and 5 mmoL/L, bicarbonate between 20 and 24 mmoL/L. Hepatic polyadenomatosis remained stable on regular MRI follow-up since the age of 22.\\nHe had no renal disease. Proteinuria and microalbuminuria were negative, creatinine clearance was 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cockroft-Gault), calciuria was low. It is noteworthy that renal cysts had never been observed, either on MRI or on ultrasound examination.\\nHe was referred when he was 25 year-old in our center for his annual follow-up.

        "note": "A 64-year-old male presented with gross hematuria. His past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, erectile dysfunction, and surgery for diverticulosis. Recent investigations revealed a creatinine level of 104 \u00b5mol/L and a glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. A computerized tomography urogram revealed a right-to-left CFRE, which roughly approximated a horseshoe kidney (Figure ). The urogram also identified a filling defect in the left upper pole of the fused kidney (Figure ). The renal tissue was biopsied using videoscopic ureteroscopy and pathology identified a high-grade pTa lesion. Given the stage and location of the lesion, the chosen treatment was nephrectomy of the left moiety with ureterectomy and bladder cuff excision.\\nThe patient was positioned in the supine position with exposure of both the lower abdomen and the penis. A flexible cystoscope was introduced via the urethra and ureteral stents were placed inside both the left and right moieties of the kidney, allowing for accurate differentiation of the two collecting systems. Next, a large midline incision was made from the umbilicus to the pubic symphysis. The descending colon and small intestine were then mobilized and reflected to expose the fused kidney and the left renal vein.\\nTwo branches from the left renal vein to the kidney were identified: one extending to the left moiety and the other to the right moiety. The left renal artery was then identified posterior to the renal vein. Accessory arterial branches were dissected, and ligation was placed just distal to the single branch supplying the right moiety of the kidney. The veins corresponding to the left moiety were then ligated and dissected. Finally, the portion of the artery distal to the ligation was dissected, providing full control of the left moiety vasculature. Next, the kidney was skeletonized until a clear area of demarcation emerged between the vasculature of the two moieties. Pressure was applied to the isthmus separating the two moieties to achieve reasonable hemostasis, and a sharp incision was made to release the left moiety from the right. Blood loss at this stage was minimal, as both gross and parenchymal bleeding were quickly controlled.\\nUreterectomy and bladder cuff excision were subsequently performed without any difficulties. Upon reassessment of the kidney, there was no evidence of bleeding in the hilum and the remaining moiety appeared to be well-perfused. A node dissection was briefly considered but was ultimately not performed given the complexity of the vasculature and the risk to the remaining portion of the kidney. Overall, the surgery was completed without complications and the estimated blood loss was 1400 mL.\\nThe final pathology revealed a high-grade T3 papillary urothelial carcinoma with negative margins. On gross examination, the tumor appeared to invade through the renal calyces into the parenchyma. The lesion was located more than 2.5 cm from the renal vein and did not appear to extend into the renal sinus fat. Microscopic evaluation revealed no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.\\nPostoperatively, the patient recovered well despite the size and complexity of the surgery. In the weeks following the operation, he developed left-sided testicular pain and swelling consistent with epididymitis. The presumed infection was treated with ciprofloxacin. A scrotal ultrasound was also performed to confirm the benignity of the testicular symptoms. Postoperative investigations revealed a glomerular filtration rate of 46 mL/min/1.73 m2 (at 40 days) and a creatinine clearance of 67 mL/min (at 66 days). Adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy was initiated at three months following the operation and continued for four 21-day cycles. At nine months, the patient was doing well with no evidence of metastatic disease on clinical examination or imaging. Investigations at this time revealed a creatinine level of 169 \u00b5mol/L.",

His weight taken on 19 June 2019 was 62.6 kg with a height of 1.60 cm, giving a body mass index of 24.4 kg/m2. The patient was on the following oral medications (Box ) long term prior to the addition of rivaroxaban 10 mg OM for chronic atrial flutter and previous ischemic stroke.\\nHe had an episode of severe infective exacerbation of COPD as a result of postviral pneumonia, which was complicated by septic shock, multiorgan failure, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and new anemia in December 2018, for which he was admitted to the intensive care unit for inotrope support and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The liver and respiratory function recovered, but the renal function did not and led to new chronic kidney disease, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 31 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equations on 19 June 2019. He developed new atrial flutter which persisted but was not started on oral anticoagulation immediately due to concerns with regards the new multiorgan failure and unexplained new anemia in the intensive care unit.

An initial consultation with the family physician had diagnosed influenza but shivers, photophobia, and testicular pain appeared 24 h later. Subsequent physical examination found new purpuric lesions on the trunk and upper limbs (Fig. ) leading to admission to hospital.\\nAt admission, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was 121/47 mmHg, heart rate was 116 bpm, oxygen saturation was 94% in room air, and his temperature was 38.4\u00b0C. He was slightly drowsy with a Coma Glasgow Scale score of 13, with left parietal headache, nausea and neck stiffness. Cardiovascular, pulmonary and abdominal examination was normal. Laboratory analysis of blood samples revealed high levels of C-reactive protein (106 mg/L), hyperleukocytosis (24 \u00d7 109 white blood cells/L, of which 94% were neutrophils), and acute non-obstructive renal failure (3.46 mg/dL serum creatinine, corresponding to creatinine clearance of 24 mL/min).\\nBlood cultures were taken and a lumbar puncture was performed, followed immediately by intravenous (IV) administration of 2 g cefotaxime. The CSF was crystal clear and no hyper-pressure was observed upon puncture of the dura mater. Biochemical analysis of the CSF revealed normal glycorrachia (3.0 mmol/L, with 4.8 mmol/L glycaemia), normal protein content (0.22 g/L) and elevated levels of lactate (5.8 mmol/L). Cyto-microbiological analysis found no CSF pleiocytosis (6 leukocytes/mm3) and the absence of bacteria as determined by Gram staining.\\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of purpura fulminans with uncertain meningitis. During the following 12 h, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome progressively appeared with the following features: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [elevated prothrombin time (PT) (26%), elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (2.54), low fibrinogen (1 .4g/L), thrombopenia (62 \u00d7 109 platelets/L), elevated D-dimers (> 10.000 ng/mL) and low factor V (21%)]; severe hypotension resistant to 20 mL/kg fluid resuscitation and requiring treatment with 0.4 \u03bcg/kg/min norepinephrine; non-obstructive acute renal failure; acute lung injury with mild pulmonary oedema upon chest X-ray and no cardiac failure upon the first echocardiographic examination (left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 70%), requiring oxygen delivery through a mask up to 9 L/min flow, and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.28, lactate 6.4 mmol/L). In addition, plasma procalcitonin (PCT) levels were very high (521 \u03bcg/L). Encephalic computerised tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ruled out the presence of a pharyngeal or cerebral abscess, cerebral thrombophlebitis, sinusitis, mastoiditis, and ethmoiditis. The patient was treated IV with 250 mg/kg/day cefotaxime.\\nNeisseria meningitidis was first identified in the blood cultures after 15 h, confirming the diagnosis of meningococcemia with purpura fulminans and shock. Numerous N. meningitidis colony-forming units were then identified in the CSF cultures 24 h after sampling. Furthermore, pathological examination of skin biopsies taken from purpuric areas revealed thrombosis of all the dermal capillaries associated with the presence of cocci in several vessels (Fig. ). The N. meningitidis strain isolated belonged to serogroup C and was fully susceptible to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations for penicillin, amoxicillin and ceftriaxone of 0.047, 0.125, and < 0.016 mg/L, respectively). The patient had never been vaccinated against meningococcus. Human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative.\\nOrgan failure improved by the second day after admission. Oxygen delivery was decreased to 4 L/min and the norepinephrine infusion rate reduced to 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min.

There were no other remarkable findings on physical examination including conjunctivae, oral mucosa, cervical lymph nodes, thyroid, heart, respiratory sounds, abdomen, and skin.\\nLaboratory findings showed hypoglycemia (casual glucose value 1.8 mmol/L), worsening of renal dysfunction (urea nitrogen 12 mmol/L, creatinine 0.22 mmol/L), anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL, hematocrit 29.2%), hyperkalemia (5.8 mmol/L), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.62 mmol/L). The rest of the findings were normal, including complete blood cell count, coagulation tests, serum transferases, sodium, calcium, phosphate, and C-reactive protein. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 6.9%, and glycated albumin was 21.6% on admission.\\nBecause of the laboratory findings, 40 mL of 40% dextrose solution was given intravenously. Blood glucose level rose to 9.6 mmol/L, his signs resolved quickly, and hypoglycemic hemiparesis was diagnosed. Glimepiride, metformin, and valsartan were discontinued. As the neurological signs disappeared quickly on improvement of blood glucose, it was easy to exclude an ischemic stroke. Emergency head imaging was not done. After 48 hours' observation, he was discharged, and no relapse of hypoglycemic attack has been documented to date. The 24-hour urine collection showed no microalbuminuria.",

There had been two more episodes of joint complaints but fever had not recurred. Her body weight was 57 kg at a length of 170 cm, blood pressure was 105/70 mmHg and no abnormalities were noticed apart from a slightly distended abdomen and some oedema of the legs.

Whitish plaques without erosions or erythema were also seen in the terminal ileum and coecal region at colonoscopy. Biopsy specimens of these plaques showed infiltration with macrophages, staining positive with PAS, establishing the diagnosis of WD (Figure ). PCR confirmed the presence of T. whipplei.\\nInitial treatment consisted of ceftriaxone 2 g administered intravenously once daily followed by co-trimoxazole 960 mg b.i.d. orally. Because she developed a skin rash and elevation of liver enzymes, an allergy to co-trimoxazole was suspected; therefore, ceftriaxone was restarted. Further, she was started on parenteral nutrition for malnutrition.\\nDuring the follow-up, she developed a severe nephrotic syndrome with proteinuria up to 15 g/24 h and serum albumin 8 g/L.

On physical examination, his blood pressure was 105/68 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 beats per min, and body temperature was 38.2\u2103. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness on the whole abdomen, diminished bowel sound, and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin concentration of 12.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 7,580/\u00b5L, platelet count of 233,000/\u00b5L, serum creatinine level of 1.36 mg/dL, serum bilirubin level of 5.0 mg/dL, and serum albumin level of 2.5 g/dL. The analysis of peritoneal fluid demonstrated an albumin level of 284 mg/dL and leukocyte count of 350/\u00b5L (poly 89%, other 5%). The Child-Pugh score was 13. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hr) was started with the presumptive diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Several days later, gram negative bacilli were growing in the cultures of blood and ascites processed by the BACTEC 9240 unit (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, U.S.A.). The patient's subsequent hospital course was uneventful except for low-grade fever (\u226438\u2103). On the 8th day of admission, his blood pressure was 66/40 mmHg, pulse rate was 94 beats per min, and body temperature was 35.2\u2103. Laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin concentration of 11.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 13,670/\u00b5L, platelet count of 232,000/\u00b5L, creatinine level of 2.26 mg/dL, ascitic albumin level of 470 mg/dL, and ascitic leukocyte count of 1,190/\u00b5L (poly 46%, other 50%). We tried to perform an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) because of his black and tarry stool, but the patient and his family refused to give his consent to EGD. At that time, the gram-negative bacillus was identified as O. anthropi by the Gram negative Combo 32 kit (Microscan Workaway-96, Dade Behring, West Sacramento, CA, U.S.A.), and the biochemical profile determined by the API 20 NE system (BioMerieus, Marcy l'Etoile, France) also gave unequivocal identification of O. anthropi. The organism yielded positive results in tests for urea, ornithine, and esculin hydrolysis and failed to produce hydrogen sulfide in triple-sugar-iron agar, which is collectively consistent with O. anthropi. The isolate was in vitro susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trimethoprim but resistant to all other tested (\u03b2-lactam antibiotics including ceftriaxone). The antibiotic was changed to imipenem (250 mg every 6 hr).",

We therefore proposed a treatment with full-dose crizotinib (250 mg twice a day) despite the renal impairment (creatinine: 2.22 mg/dL; creatinine clearance: 33 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation) of unknown origin. Renal biopsy was estimated unsafe and was not performed because the patient had a solitary kidney (a nephrectomy had been performed when she was 18 years old for an unclear reason). In the absence of explanation provided by 24-hour urine analysis, blood tests, and urinary tract imaging, we hypothesized that the renal dysfunction was secondary to anti-inflammatory drugs used for headaches and/or to the nephrotoxicity of anterior chemotherapy agents. Few weeks after the initiation of full-dose crizotinib, she recovered a good general status (ECOG 0) and thoracoabdominal computed tomography confirmed a partial tumor response. We therefore pursued crizotinib at the same dose despite a worsening of the renal function (creatinine: 3.36 mg/dL).",

He was diagnosed in the outpatient setting as having gastroesophageal reflux disease with biliary regurgitation and, therefore, was given high doses of calcium containing antacids. A therapy with calcium antagonists was also initiated because of increased levels of blood pressure.\\nUpon admission, he was well oriented, with slightly yellowish skin color, his blood pressure was 160/100 mmHg, his heart rate was 96/min. The rest of the physical examination was normal. He was a non-smoker and his past medical history was normal. The following initial analyzes have been performed:\\nThe patient had severe hypercalcemia and anemia, renal insufficiency, metabolic alkalosis. Serum parathyroid hormone was almost undetectable. His lipids were normal, too and urine culture negative. All the available tumor markers were normal (CEA, AFP, CA 19-9, NSE, CYFRA 21-1, PSA, Ferritin). He was hepatitis B, C and HIV negative. Renal ultrasound was normal. Ultrasound of the parathyroid glands was normal. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed normal findings. Bone biopsy showed osteoporosis and scattered zones with osteonecrosis. Renal biopsy showed tubulointerstitial lesions with calcium deposits in the interstitial tissue. Chest X-ray was also normal. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract while hospitalized showed no pathologic changes. Beta-2 microglobulin, acid phosphatase, kappa and lambda light chains were normal. Coombs test and immunoelectrophoresis of proteins were negative. The calculated creatinine clearance at admission was 42 ml/min. The whole body Tc99m MDP bone scan was normal, as well as the parathyroid glands Tc99m MIBI scan. Cranial X-ray, as well as radiographs of hands and feet, was normal. He had mild metabolic alkalosis, and his ECG showed signs of hypercalcemia (shortened QT interval of 0.32 sec and abnormal ST morphology in V2, V3 and V4) (Figs. and ).\\nThe patient was hydrated with intravenous fluid, treated with bisphosphonates, corticosteroids and calcium antagonists for his elevated blood pressure. Antacids were stopped promptly after admission. He was also given vitamin B12 and folic acid upon the recommendation of a hematologist. The serum level of calcium decreased slowly to 2.6 mmol/l at the 43rd day after admission, and serum creatinine decreased to 154 \u03bcmol/l.",

        "note": "This previously healthy 3-year-old boy presented with renal failure, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and hypertension in the absence of a preceding diarrhoeal illness. The diagnosis of aHUS was confirmed by renal biopsy, which showed diffuse glomerular basement membrane thickening and splitting with subendothelial fibrinoid deposition. Endothelium swelling associated with wall thickening in some arteries was also visible. Neither glomerulosclerosis nor tubular atrophy was observed. The clinical evolution is outlined in Fig. . Dialysis (initially hemodialysis and subsequently peritoneal dialysis) was started because of salt and water retention. The patient was never anuric, and the maximum plasma creatinine level was 270 \u00b5mol/L. Dialysis was stopped after 2 months when the plasma creatinine was 110 \u00b5mol/L. Two weeks after presentation, the patient developed seizures secondary to malignant hypertension and was admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit where daily PE was commenced (40 ml/kg per session of fresh frozen plasma). After a further 2 weeks, his clinical condition improved, his platelet count normalized and plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) stabilized at slightly increased levels. Eight weeks after presentation, he was transferred to our centre for creation of an arterio-venous shunt and chronic prophylactic PE. The frequency of PE was reduced to three times a week until the plasma creatinine level returned to 47 \u00b5mol/L 5 months after presentation. The frequency of PE was then reduced to twice weekly and then to once a week thereafter. Of note, the plasma LDH values never normalized completely. The plasma concentration of the complement factors C3, C3d, C4, Factor B, AP 50 and CH 50 were normal and remained so throughout the course of his illness. Growth retardation was present until renal transplantation. Hypertension was difficult to control until the introduction of AII receptors blockers 6 months after presentation. For the next 24 months, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria and blood pressure remained normal, and no hospitalization was needed. There were many short episodes of absence which were treated satisfactory with valproic acid and lamotrigine. Computed tomography scanning showed no cerebral lesions. During the third year after presentation, the plasma creatinine level rose progressively from normal values to 127 \u00b5mol/L.",

Initial vital signs by EMS showed a blood pressure (BP) of 183/108 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 103 beats per minute (bpm), and blood glucose of 302 mg/dL. He was able to mumble some answer verbally but remained disoriented. As the patient was being transferred to the ambulance, he became aggressive and combative. He was administered 10 mg midazolam intramuscularly and brought in the ED at Brookdale University Hospital Medicine Center. Prior to the presentation, home medications included levetiracetam 750 mg tablets twice daily with which he was not fully compliant as per his family. Chart review revealed multiple ED visits for seizures due to non-compliance with the medication. In the ED, he received another dose of midazolam, 4 mg to terminate the residual seizure activity and also received haloperidol and ketamine due to agitation with combativeness after his initial seizure episode. Vital signs in the ED were within normal limits except a HR of 142 bpm. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. The patient remained afebrile, but it was noted that his BP began to rise and was recorded at 133/109 mmHg. Soon thereafter, the patient was noticed to be in a phase of status epilepticus and eventually was intubated for airway protection.\\nPhysical examination revealed the patient to be intubated and sedated, equal-sized pupils reactive to light, intact brainstem reflexes, no signs of major trauma on his body. He received 4 g of intravenous levetiracetam as a loading dose and was continued with 1000 mg of levetiracetam intravenously every 12 hours thereafter. Initial laboratory investigations revealed an elevated lactic acid level of >12 mmol/L, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and creatinine kinase level of 1004 U/L. Clinical laboratory data has been shown in Table . His baseline creatinine level was within normal limits at 0.9 mg/dL about four years ago and he did not have any previous history of kidney disease. Venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.07 and bicarbonate level of 14.4 mmol/L indicating metabolic acidosis most likely due to prolonged seizure activity. Urine toxicology was positive for cannabinoids.

        "note": "A 50-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) at SUNY Downstate Medical Center with complaint of intermittent epigastric pain that began a few days prior. The patient was slightly confused at time of presentation but was able to provide some history. Collateral history was collected from his daughter who lives with the patient and was also present at time of the patient's presentation to the ED. The patient reported that his epigastric pain was nonradiating, associated with nausea along with multiple episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis. The patient also reported subjective fevers, chills, and cough for one week. He denied any flank pain, changes in bowel habits, appetite, or amount of oral intake. He also denied any changes in his weight. His daughter, however, noted that over the past week, she observed a decrease in the patient's appetite and oral intake. Patient's medical history was significant for hypertension, for which he did not take any medication, and hepatitis B (Hep B), for which he was hospitalized in 1983. He was unable to recall the cause of the hepatitis. He denied any history of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drug, or recent NSAID use. He does not take any prescribed or over-the-counter medications. His family history was unremarkable.\\nA thorough occupational history collected later in the course of hospitalization revealed that the patient has worked in the aviation industry as an aircraft refueler at a local airport, where he refuels up to nine aircrafts per day for the past three and half years. At work, the patient reports wearing a uniform and \u201clong medical gloves,\u201d which he described as being approximately five times the thickness of standard hospital gloves. He also stated that he wears a respirator mask about 60% of the time during refueling. The patient reported direct skin contact with jet fuel when it spills onto his arms at least three times per day on average, despite wearing a uniform and gloves. He mentioned one instance, where he was completely covered in jet fuel. He also noted that he could often smell fuel on his hands for several days after a spill. At time of admission, the patient was oliguric and in acute renal failure (ARF) as his serum chemistry showed a strikingly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine that were each about 20 times over the normal limits. He was normotensive, and his physical exam was only revealing of dry mucous membranes, clear lungs, and a cardiac exam that was within normal limits. He had no edema of his lower extremities bilaterally. The cause of his ARF was unknown at this time.\\nThe patient's hospital course included extensive medical and diagnostic testing to investigate the etiology of his acute renal failure. His baseline renal function was unknown. The patient's initial serum chemistry showed a BUN level of 215 mg/dL and creatinine level of 20.41 mg/dL with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 3 mL/min/1.73 m2. Electrolytes showed slight hyponatremia with a serum sodium level of 126 mmol/L, normal serum potassium level of 4.6 mmol/L, blood glucose level of 130 mg/dL, normal magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL, modest hyperphosphatemia level of 5.3 mg/dL, calcium level of 9.1 mg/dL, and a mild metabolic acidosis with a serum bicarbonate level of 17 mmol/L. The patient was seen by the Nephrology consultation service who recommended continuing aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) hydration and strict urine output monitoring and deferred on initiating renal replacement therapy at the time. The patient had placement of an indwelling Foley catheter for strict urine output measurement. His urinalysis was mainly unrevealing showing no glucosuria, no proteinuria, 11 white blood cells, 6 red blood cells per high-power field, and a specific gravity of 1.010.",

Emesis was nonbloody, nonbilious without hematemesis. Further history revealed that he recently moved from Michigan to South Carolina 3 weeks prior where he started boot camp after joining the Marine Corp. In preparation, he had been lifting weights and taking protein and creatine supplements. His symptoms correlated with the initiation of boot camp. There were no associated fevers, dysuria, or other symptoms.\\nHe had been healthy his entire life with no past medical disorders or surgical procedures, and was not taking any medications. Social history revealed he was sexually active with women, occasionally without condom use. On examination, he was a thin male with mild muscle wasting. Vital signs were normal and he was comfortable appearing. His abdomen was soft with mild tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper quadrant without rebound or guarding. There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease and no scleral icterus.\\nLaboratory data revealed a white blood cell count 14 400/cm3 (34% neutrophils, 18% lymphocytes, 33% reactive lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils), hemoglobin 18.3 g/dL, hematocrit 52%, and platelet count 165 000/cm3. Metabolic panel revealed a creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 263 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 893 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase 192 IU/L. The international normalized ratio was 1.03. Creatinine kinase was 11 IU/L. Urinalysis was normal. Right upper quadrant ultrasound with Doppler revealed a normal biliary system with patent vasculature. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a trivial nonbleeding esophageal ulcer, and he was started on esomeprazole. Viral studies for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) returned normal. Given evidence of reactive lymphocytes on the white blood cell differential, a peripheral smear was obtained. The atypical cells were felt by our hematologic pathologist to be most consistent with a viral process. He was discharged with a working diagnosis of hepatocellular liver injury due to viral-induced hepatitis or drug-induced hepatitis (secondary to supplements), with expected improvement over the next few weeks. He was discharged with close outpatient follow-up for his acute kidney injury.\\nSix days after discharge, the patient re-presented with worsening of symptoms. He continued to describe nausea, vomiting, decreased PO intake, and progressive fatigue. Since discharge, he had lost another 10 pounds. Admission laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 17 320/cm3 (56% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 10% reactive lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils), creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, total bilirubin 2.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 225 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 869 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase 191 IU/L. Given the persistent abnormalities in his liver tests, a liver biopsy was performed and revealed modest hepatocyte apoptosis and scattered portal and lobular inflammatory cells (primarily lymphocytes) felt to be consistent with drug-induced or viral hepatitis ().",

The patient's elevated serum creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 22 mL/min/1.73 m2(Schwartz formula), was consistent with stage III AKI based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification []. Urinalysis was positive for proteinuria and microscopic hematuria (>50 red blood cells per high-power field) without signs of infection. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable, excluding any inflammatory or obstructive process. The toxicology screen was found to be negative as well.\\nWhile treated empirically with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam) and intravenous fluids, the patient's mental status improved, but her serum chemistries continued to worsen, prompting transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit with a diagnosis of ALI complicated by stage III AKI. On her second day of admission, preliminary infectious workup (including aerobic blood cultures, polymerase chain reaction, and serology for common viral etiologies) returned positive for influenza A infection, although she did not have fever, rhinorrhea, or any upper respiratory tract symptoms. Further diagnostic evaluation included acylcarnitine, urine organic acid, and amino acid profiles, all of which were within the normal range. To determine the etiology of the patient's ALI, she underwent a transjugular liver biopsy that revealed submassive hepatocellular necrosis with microvascular steatosis, suggesting metabolic rather than autoimmune etiology (Fig. ).\\nAlthough encephalopathy, hyperammonemia, and overall liver function improved with conservative medical management, the patient's renal function continued to deteriorate. Despite an adequate urine output, her serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine continued to worsen (44 and 4.8 mg/dL, respectively), with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 13 mL/min/1.73 m2. Due to the development of 5% fluid overload with pulmonary congestion and a new oxygen requirement, acute intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. An intrinsic kidney insult was suggested by elevated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels of 4,182 ng/mL (reference <50 ng/mL).",

        "note": "This is a case of a 72-year-old Taiwanese man who was diagnosed as having metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung complicated by malignant right pleural effusion 2 years ago. He initially presented with weight loss, worsening cough, and worsening exertional shortness of breath for 3 months prior to presentation. He had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled on insulin. He was an ex-smoker of tobacco with a tobacco smoking history of one pack a day for 10 years but he quit smoking tobacco 20 years ago. He also had a family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in his brother and breast cancer in his niece. He is retired and lives with his wife.\\nOn examination, he was afebrile with heart rate of 70 beats/minute and with blood pressure (BP) of 130/80 mmHg. He appeared moderately built and was not in any respiratory distress. His respiratory examination was significant for dullness over the right middle and lower chest on percussion and was associated with reduced breath sounds on auscultation. His cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examinations were non-contributory.\\nHis initial computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated a middle lobe mass in his right lung and right lung pleural effusion. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed an increased uptake in the middle lobe mass in his right lung, subcarinal lymph nodes, several bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, and diffuse osseous metastasis. There was no evidence of brain metastasis as evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain. He then had thoracentesis and pleural biopsy with the placement of a pleural catheter. The pleural biopsy was consistent with adenocarcinoma with an acinar pattern. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor cells was positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and negative for CK20. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed evidence of ALK mutation (33% of cells positive for rearrangement). His final diagnosis was stage IV ALK + adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastasis to pleura, mediastinum, and bones. Before the information of ALK positivity was obtained, he was started on combination chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, Alimta (pemetrexed), and Avastin (bevacizumab) of which he successfully completed five cycles. He was followed up regularly in the clinic every 4 weeks. He tolerated the chemotherapy and had a good response with 30% reduction in the lung mass size. He was later started on crizotinib 250 mg twice per day and had a significant response with improved tumor burden in his metastatic sites. He followed up in the clinic every 4 weeks initially for 6 months and then every 8 weeks for 1 year. During his follow-up visits, he remained stable with no evidence of disease progression. He remained on crizotinib for over a year and tolerated it well. During one of the follow-up clinic visits at around 18 months after diagnosis, an MRI scan of his brain was arranged due to a new symptom of headache; it showed numerous brain metastases which was consistent with progression of his disease. A decision was made to stop crizotinib and to start alectinib 600 mg twice daily coupled with cranial radiation.\\nWithin 5 weeks of starting alectinib, he developed ARF with his creatinine (Cr) increasing up to 8.16 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to 113 mg/dl. He was anuric at presentation and his laboratory tests were consistent with hyperkalemia and acidosis with a potassium level of 7.1 mEq/L and bicarbonate (HCO3) of < 9 mmol/L. His renal workup revealed BUN/Cr ratio of 13, urine sodium of > 83 mEq/L, and urine osmolality of 334 mOsm/kg.",

Four years before the admission, she had been admitted for high spiking fever, evanescent morbilliform rash, polyarthritis, neutrophilic leukocytosis and hyperferritinemia (21,239 ng/mL). At that time she had been diagnosed as a flare-up of AOSD by Yamaguchi's criteria (), and the course of the disease had been improved with moderate dose of prednisolone (PSL).\\nSince the first admission, she had had recurrent episodes of fever, rash and polyarthritis mimicked rheumatoid arthritis. Her symptoms were dependent on PSL, and the course of the disease did not change in spite of concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, bucillamine, azathioprine, cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide. One month prior to the admission, she had been treated with famciclovir (750 mg/day) for 1 week due to acute herpes zoster rash on left forearm. Until 4 days before the admission, she had received PSL (5 mg/day), hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day) and sulindac (200 mg/day) for a month, as well as elemental iron (80 mg/day) for 8 months because of iron deficiency anemia.\\nOn admission (4th day after the onset), she appeared acutely ill with a confused mental status.

She reported chronic mild diffuse abdominal tenderness with right-sided abdominal tenderness developing suddenly, described as sharp pain radiating to her back. The patient had gone to multiple hospitals for treatment; however, she had been turned away for concern about drug-seeking behavior. The patient was taking high doses of hydromorphone (4 mg three times a day) for her abdominal pain and diazepam 5 mg daily as needed for anxiety for the last several months. She denied trauma, fever, chills, diarrhea, dysuria, and hematuria.\\nOn admission, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 92 beats per minute. Blood pressure was elevated at 173/93 mmHg and oxygen saturation was normal on room air. Physical examination was significant for abdominal surgical scars and right flank tenderness. No rebound tenderness was present. Laboratory workup was significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.7 K/mm3 with a neutrophil predominance (80.8%), hemoglobin (Hgb) of 17.9 gm/dl, platelets (PLT) of 368 K/mm3, anion gap of 17 mEq/L, creatinine of 4.8 mg/dL, and GFR of 9 mL/min/1.73 m2. Lactic acid, albumin, lipase, and lipid panels were unremarkable. Seven months prior to her presentation, the patient's kidney functions had been within normal limits, but a month after, she had been noted to have fluctuating creatinine and stage 4 CKD, which can be seen in Figure . Her acute kidney injury (AKI) had been attributed to HTN and PRES, which had improved with conservative management. She had been discharged at that time with a recommendation for outpatient and nephrology follow-up.\\nOn presentation in the emergency room, imaging with contrast was not performed due to her acute renal failure and concerns for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Alternatively, the patient underwent a non-contrast CT of her abdomen and pelvis, which showed stable calcifications in the central abdomen favoring chronic pancreatitis, severe atrophy of left kidney greater than right, right renal vascular calcifications, and stable postsurgical changes from cholecystectomy and femoral-femoral bypass surgery (Figure ). She was started empirically on ceftriaxone for suspected pyelonephritis versus other abdominal sources of infection such as abscess, intravenous fluids, ondansetron, morphine, and fentanyl. On day two, the patient\u2019s symptoms persisted with increased leukocytosis of 17.1 K/mm3 with worsening creatinine and GFR. She reported anuria overnight and was transitioned to piperacillin/tazobactam for empiric treatment of an abdominal source of infection. Nephrology and general surgery were consulted for further evaluation. Due to unremarkable imaging and labs, general surgery suspected that the patient\u2019s symptoms were likely chronic due to a known history of chronic pancreatitis.\\nNephrology performed further workup of fluctuating creatinine. Urinalysis was obtained by straight catheterization, which was negative for infection and red blood cells but had a prominent urine protein of 100 mg/dL. Urine protein creatinine ratio was calculated to be 13.6 g/day (normal level: <0.2 g/day, nephrotic range: >3.5 g/day).",

His past medical history included tuberculosis in childhood, but at the point of admission he was not being treated with any medication. He had been living as a homeless man for more than 10 years in Tokyo, where he had been eating food discarded from restaurants around Shibuya and Nakano and had been staying in public parks such as Jingu-Gaien during the night. He recalled that rodents such as rats had been present around his places of residence. He had not been eating well up to a few days before hospitalization.\\nHis physical examination revealed that his height was 157cm and his body weight was 48.6kg. His level of consciousness, based on the Glasgow Coma Scale, was E4V4M6. His axillary temperature was 38\u00b0C, his blood pressure was 127/64mmHg, his respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min, and his heart rate was 102 beats/min. He reported tenderness in bilateral lower limbs. His left lower calf was red and warm compared with the right side. Other than his impaired level of consciousness, no significant findings were apparent during his neurological examination.\\nHis blood test results were aspartate aminotransferase, 272IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 153IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 675IU/L; creatine kinase, 9048IU/L; blood urea nitrogen, 122.9mg/dl; creatinine, 5.11mg/dl; C-reactive protein (CRP), 16.02mg/dl; sodium, 135mEq/L; white blood cells, 15,000/\u03bcl; hemoglobin, 10.9g/dl; platelets, 3.9\u00d7104/\u03bcl; and fibrinogen, 814mg/dl. Other test results are shown in Table . The remainder of the examination results were normal, such as blood levels of potassium, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrin degradation products. Chest radiography and abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed nothing significant.\\nThe clinical course of the patient is shown in Fig. . His condition satisfied the diagnostic criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome []. Severe sepsis was diagnosed and he was admitted to the critical care unit. Blood, urine and sputum cultures were collected and analyzed with no significant findings. Although the laboratory test results for this patient showed marked multi-organ involvement, the constellation of characteristic features of high fever, lower calf pain, elevated white blood cell count, elevated CRP level, acute renal failure, liver failure and thrombocytopenia suggested a strong possibility of leptospirosis than other etiologies. The patient also had a history of exposure to rodents and their excrement, so we considered leptospirosis as the first diagnostic option and started antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone (4g/day). On day 2, fever and redness and warmth of the left lower calf disappeared. On day 3, maximal axillary temperature was 37\u00b0C, and the patient did not subsequently present with fever.\\nIn contrast, the patient\u2019s thrombocytopenia progressed, and his platelet count on day 3 was 8000/\u03bcl. Although his platelet count was low, no clinical signs of bleeding were identified. Because thrombocytopenia in leptospirosis is transient and does not result from disseminated intravascular coagulation [], we decided not to perform a transfusion immediately. Recovery was seen starting from day 4 and had normalized by day 9. His total bilirubin level continued to rise, reaching 8.1mg/dl on day 7 before starting to decrease, and reaching 4.7mg/dl on day 14.\\nRegarding renal failure, 24-h urine collection was performed to evaluate the cause.",

She was prescribed subcutaneous injection of PEG-IFN\u03b1-2a at a dose of 180 \u03bcg per week to treat chronic hepatitis. After initiation of therapy, a low-grade fever and mild general fatigue were observed. Psychiatric symptoms such as enervation, palpitations, an episode of hyperventilation, and consciousness disturbances with myotonia appeared after the third injection of PEG-IFN\u03b1-2a. It was impossible to decide if the symptoms were IFN-related or due to a somatization disorder elicited by anxiety, but the IFN therapy was discontinued and followed by administration of etizolam and paroxetine hydrochloride hydrate treatment by psychiatrists. Although the symptoms gradually improved, it took 3 months for the patient to completely recover (Fig. ); the anti-anxiety medications were continued for a prolonged period. While waiting for approval of DAA therapy, the patient was administered liver supporting therapies: oral ursodeoxycholic acid and glycyrrhizinate. Upon approval, the patient was administrated with IFN-free sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination therapy. She was 57 years at this time point and 8 years had elapsed since the PEG-IFN therapy.

        "note": "A previously healthy 34-year-old woman suddenly lost consciousness and collapsed at her home []. On admission to emergency department (ED), she was comatose, with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 7 (e3v2m2), a little shortness of breath upon exertion, and flaccid in all extremities. Her family denied vomiting prior to the admission, or history of ingestion of other medications, trauma, neurological disease, and coagulopathy. However, her life signs became unstable, as evidenced by a high fever (39.5\u00b0C), a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 195/85 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her pulse oximetric saturation (SpO2) was 98% on 3 L/min oxygen. Laboratory tests did not demonstrate any significant abnormality. The non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan on admission revealed cerebellar vermis and right-sided acute large hematoma in the ventricular system. Also, blood in the ventricular system that resulted in a mild hydrocephalus was observed []. Diagnosis of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage was made.\\nAn hour later, respiratory dysfunction was observed with shortness of breath, and coughing with pink-tinged, frothy sputum appeared while bilateral crackles were noted. SpO2 decreased to 70% despite administering continuous supplementary oxygen of 10 L/min. The diagnosis of NPE was made, with a severe CNS injury. The indwelling gastric tube was used for gastrointestinal decompression to avoid the risk of gastric aspiration. Prompt endotracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was given. In the course of patient's transportation from ED to the Neuroscience Care Unit (NCU), hypotension, tachycardia, and bradycardia occurred. Ringer's lactate, colloids, atropine, and norepinephrine were used to stabilize patient's life signs. When she was in NCU, her GCS deteriorated to e1vTm2. She also developed progressive and severe hypoxia, despite mechanical ventilation with an inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) of 100% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cm H2O during pressure control ventilation. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed pH 7.27, PaCO2 46.5mmHg, PaO2 66.7 mmHg, HCO3\u221220.8 mmol/L, and O2 saturation 92%. Chest X-ray was immediately performed, and diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were observed []. Electrocardiogram showed a sinus bradycardia of 52 beats per minute, but no ischemia. The neurosurgical team was consulted for the cerebellar haemorrhage and agreed that the best course of management was conservative for her unstable blood pressure and poor hypoxia. Thereafter, she received dobutamine to treat a possible cardiogenic component of the pulmonary edema. Although supportive measures were given including hyperventilation, repeated administration of mannitol and furosemide, and propofol sedation, the patient's condition exacerbated. A repeat chest X-ray exhibited bilateral ground-glass opacities and diffuse interstitial infiltrates []. ABG analysis showed pH 7.40, PaCO2 40 mmHg, PaO2 70 mmHg, HCO3\u2212 27 mmol/L, and O2 saturation 92% on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) with 100% FiO2. The patient was in deep coma, and concomitant multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was diagnosed 24 h after hospital admission.",

        "note": "A 30-year-old previously healthy Japanese woman, who had fever and headache for five days, presented with disorganized speech, unusual behavior and delusional thinking. After two days, the level of consciousness decreased and the patient was admitted to our hospital.\\nShe was comatose and had a fever (39.1\u00b0C). The Glasgow coma score (GCS) was 7: eye opening, verbal response and motor response were 1, 2 and 4, respectively. Meningismus was present. Her eyeballs deviated to the left; the pupils were equal and normally reactive to light. The deep tendon reflexes were normal, with no pathological reflex. As she had frequently experienced generalized seizures with hypoventilation, the patient received mechanical ventilation. Intravenous sedation (midazolam) was started. The white cell count was 18200/\u03bcL and the C-reactive protein concentration was elevated (13.5 mg/dL). Other blood cell counts and the results of routine biochemical analysis were normal. Cranial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral regions of increased signal intensity in the hippocampus and amygdaloid body, the insular, medial temporal and medial frontal lobes (Figure and ). A lumbar puncture on day one showed 321 white cells/mm3 (93% lymphocytes, 7% polyneutrophils), 1 red cell/mm3, a protein concentration of 66 mg/dL and a glucose concentration of 74 mg/dL. Real-time PCR amplification of HSV-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive (38,000 copies/mL). HSV-1 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were not detected in the CSF. In the serum, HSV-1 IgM antibodies were absent and the HSV-1 IgG antibody titer was 26.3. HSVE was diagnosed.\\nThe patient received intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg/day, 10 days), dexamethasone (16 mg/day, five days) with tapering and immunoglobulin (5 g/day, three days). Anticonvulsant treatment with phenytoin (250 mg/day), valproate (900 mg/day) and phenobarbital (100 mg/day) was also begun. As she developed a fever (body temperature of over 40\u00b0C), her body temperature was lowered using a forced-air-cooling blanket. Her core temperature was maintained at between 36\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C for nine days.\\nCranial computed tomography (CT) performed on day five showed hemorrhagic foci in the left amygdaloid body and low-intensity bilateral lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes. We performed repeated lumbar punctures in order to evaluate the disease severity and the responses to these treatments because a reduced consciousness level and cranial neuroimaging abnormalities persisted. CSF analysis performed on day seven showed 188 lymphocytes/mm3, 38 red cells/mm3, a glucose concentration of 72 mg/dL and increased titers of HSV-1 IgM and IgG antibodies (3.08 and 6.17, respectively).\\nOn day 11 after admission, the results of real-time PCR for HSV-1 in CSF were negative, but CSF lymphocytes and red cells had increased to 189/mm3 and 125/mm3, respectively, and intracranial hemorrhage was clearly evident (Figure ). The glucose concentration in CSF was 79 mg/dL. Antiviral treatment was switched from acyclovir to intravenous vidarabine (900 mg/day, 14 days). At this time, HSV-1 IgM and IgG antibodies were 7.89 and 11.2, respectively, in the CSF and 0.56 and 76 in the serum.\\nOn day 21, sedative medication and mechanical ventilatory support were withdrawn and the GCS increased to 9 (eye opening, verbal response and motor response were 3, 2 and 4, respectively).\\nOn day 26, the level of consciousness decreased in association with desaturation and tachycardia. Thrombosis of the right pulmonary artery trunk with pulmonary embolism was evident on enhanced CT of the chest (Figure ). A high serum D-dimer persisted (maximum titer: 48.3 \u03bcg/mL). In addition, cranial CT revealed subarachnoid and intraventricular bleeding (Figure and ).\\nDuring her hospitalization, she did not experience any intermittent or persistent hypertension. Intravenous heparin (12,000 U/day) was started and the dose was adjusted according to the activated partial thromboplastin time for about a month (maximal dose of heparin, 20,400 U/day). CSF analysis on day 39 showed 6 lymphocytes/mm3, 52 red cells/mm3 and a glucose concentration of 78 mg/dL; the titers of HSV-1 IgM and IgG antibodies were 1.34 and greater than 12.8, respectively. Cranial CT on day 54 showed that the subarachnoid and intracranial bleeding had disappeared. Enhanced CT angiography demonstrated an avascular area in the left temporal lobe but no other arterial or venous abnormalities, such as aneurysm formation or irregular vascular distribution, were evident (data not shown).\\nThree months after admission, she responded to simple orders.",

At that point, no marked reddening or swelling of the upper left molar region was observed, and tooth extraction was scheduled to be performed at a later date. Dental X-rays () of the upper left molar region indicated marked alveolar bone resorption.\\nSubsequently, the patient experienced spontaneous pain and swelling in the upper left molar region and was examined at our general dental department on September 24. Pus discharge from the periodontal pocket was observed, and the area was cleaned and sterilized with normal saline solution and iodo-glycol paste. Loxoprofen sodium was prescribed as an analgesic.\\nA few days later, the swelling spread to the left buccal region and spontaneous pain became more intense, leading to more difficulty while eating for 2\u20133 days. On September 28, the primary care physician instructed the patient to visit our hospital. At 2:30 p.m. that day, upon examination at our general dental department, the Glasgow Coma Scale score was 11.

Palpation indicated a weak radial artery pulse, and the vital signs were as follows: axillary temperature, 41\u00b0C; systolic blood pressure, 80\u201390 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure, 40\u201350 mmHg; pulse rate, 130\u2013160 bpm; and SpO2, 75%\u201385%.\\nBased on the physical findings and vital signs, dehydration and septic shock were suspected. Therefore, oxygen administration at 10 L/min was immediately initiated using a face mask. A venous line was secured to the cubital fossa after the blood was drawn for a rapid blood examination, and drip infusion of acetate linger solution (500 mL) and normal saline solution (100 mL) with ampicillin sodium (2 g) was initiated. Blood examination results are shown in . Malnutrition was suspected based on albumin (2.3 g/dL) and sodium (127 mEq/L) levels, and severe infection was suspected based on white blood cell count (29,830/\u00b5L) and C-reactive protein levels (22.86 mg/dL). After the venous infusion of antibacterial drugs, there were signs of improvement, with an axillary temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, systolic blood pressure of 120\u2013130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of 80\u201390 mmHg, pulse rate of 120\u2013140 bpm, and SpO2 of 100% when oxygen was administered at 10 L/min using a face mask.",

        "note": "A 3-year-old Japanese boy was admitted to our hospital presenting with a high fever and shivering. His past medical history included congenital asplenia syndrome, an esophageal hiatal hernia after cardioplasty, and a single cardiac atrium and ventricle after a Fontan procedure. These conditions were controlled by aspirin, warfarin, diuretics, and home oxygen therapy (0.5 L/min oxygen at night). His premorbid activities of daily living (ADL) were appropriate for his age, including the ability to speak in complete sentences and the ability to walk and eat without assistance. He also had no history of hypoxic encephalopathy.\\nOn admission, he showed disturbance of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 10 (E3, V3, and M4)). Vital signs were as follows: temperature: 40.2\u00b0C; blood pressure (BP): 80/40 mmHg; heart rate (HR): 144 bpm; respiratory rate: 56/min; and oxygen saturation: 96% (0.5 L/min oxygen). Shortly after admission, the patient suffered a tonic-clonic convulsion for 30 seconds, which subsided without treatment. Laboratory data showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 21,600/\u03bcL) but were otherwise normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was also normal, and a CSF culture was negative. We diagnosed him with SE and started cefotaxime (CTX; 300 mg/kg/day) for an infection of undetermined origin.\\nAfter admission, he continued to be drowsy, and, by 4 hours after admission, his mental status had deteriorated to GCS 6 (E1, V2, and M3) with mumbling. We then started electroencephalography (EEG), which revealed rhythmical, diffuse high-voltage slow activity (), which we diagnosed as NCSE. Both electrical seizures and nonconvulsive seizures such as ocular deviation continued intermittently without full recovery of consciousness, despite the administration of midazolam and fosphenytoin. The seizures were finally controlled by phenobarbital (20 mg/kg IV) ten hours after admission (). However, the NCSE, high fever (>38\u00b0C), and hemodynamic instability (systolic BP: 80\u2013100 mmHg, HR: 150\u2013180 bpm) continued. Treatment with volume load and vasopressor therapy (dopamine drip was up to 6 mcg/kg/min) was initiated, and within several hours the hemodynamics and urine output were restored to within normal range. Although the intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness were suggestive of refractory status epilepticus, we were reluctant to initiate barbiturate coma therapy because of the hemodynamic instability. His blood culture on admission was positive for S. pneumoniae, so we then diagnosed him with sepsis due to S. pneumoniae. The next day, his hemodynamic parameters continued to improve with vasopressor therapy (dopamine drip 4.5 mcg/kg/min). At this point, neither electrical nor nonconvulsive seizures developed, so anticonvulsive therapy was discontinued. However, the patient was still drowsy, with a GCS of 6 (E1, V2, and M3).\\nOn day 3 after admission, we discontinued vasopressor therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), so his antibiotics were changed to aminobenzyl penicillin (ABPC; 300 mg/kg/day), which was continued for 14 days. His altered state of consciousness also gradually improved to GCS7 (E1, V2, and M4) on day 3 and GCS9 (E2, V2, and M5) on days 4 and 5, respectively. No seizures were observed from days 3 to 5. On day 6 after admission, the patient had a brief seizure that included rolling of the eyes and apnea; an EEG showed rhythmical, right frontal-dominant slow activity ().",

A neurological examination revealed bilateral extreme lateral and upward gaze nistagmus, global hyperreflexia, and bilateral papilledema, without hemorrhage signs. A radiological evaluation showed an abnormal mass lesion in the fourth ventricle. On a computed tomographic (CT) scan, the mass lesion was hyperdense with contrast enhancement [Figure and ]. A well-delineated mass within the ventricle was present, determining a gross obstructive hydrocephalus and effacement of the convexity sulci []. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the patient, demonstrating a large 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 cm3 intraventricular lesion with irregular contrast-enhancing margins [].\\nA midline suboccipital approach was used to excise the fourth ventricle tumor, while the patient was maintained in the sitting position. Concern that may be necessary to rapidly decompress the lateral ventricles intra- or postoperatively, a burr hole was drilled in the right posterior occipital region before the craniotomy was performed. There was no external drainage throughout the operation, but intravenous mannitol was administered. The fourth ventricle was exposed by separating the cerebellar tonsils, widening the vallecula, and allowing tumor resection in an \u201cen bloc\u201d fashion.\\nPostoperatively, the patient presented with severe left palsies in the VI, VII, IX, and X cranial nerves (CN).

Considering the aggressive nature of the disease, CHOP regimen initiated immediately after diagnosis and staging procedures. After two cycles of CHOP regimen, no significant response was achieved and ESHAP regimen initiated. After two cycles of ESHAP regimen, a short term partial response could be achieved and allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation was applied from HLA matched (10/10) sibling donor of the patient because of progressive disease []. Cells were collected peripherally and the amount of reinfused CD34+ cells was 5.3 \u00d7 106/kg. Busulfan and cyclophosphamide were used as conditioning and cyclosporine used for the prophylaxis of graft versus host disease. At the 7th day of reinfusion, acinetobacter sepsis developed and patient was put on to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. While recovering from acinetobacter sepsis, a rapid neurological and renal deterioration was observed. Patient was stuporous and had a tonic-clonic epileptic seizure; he also had a severe headache and hallucinations before the onset of seizure. Meanwhile, the ldh level was increased dramatically up to 3200 U/L and schistocytes were detected at the peripheral blood smear (20\u201330/HPF). Despite being hyponormotensive during the period of sepsis, he had hypertensive episodes with a maximum of 180/100 mmHg accompanying the neurological symptoms. Cranial MRI and lumbar puncture revealed no pathological feature. CSF culture was negative and cytological analysis revealed no malignant cells. Viral analysis of CSF and blood was negative regarding CMV and EBV. His Hb level has decreased from 9.5 to 7.2 g/dL with an MCV of 96 fL and reticulocyte count of 2.49%. Both direct and indirect coombs tests were negative and haptoglobulin level was slightly decreased below the lower limit of normal. After ruling out an ongoing infectious disease, cerebrovascular event, and malignant infiltration of CNS with lymphoma, patient was diagnosed, as TA-TMA. ADAMTS13 activity was %37 with no detectable inhibitors. All complement levels were in normal range (C3, C4, Factor H, and Factor I). Urinalysis revealed a protein concentration of 120 mg/dL. Calcineurin inhibitor stopped immediately after diagnosis and plasma exchange was initiated. Plasma exchange was performed on a daily basis with 1.5 plasma volumes, using FFP as a replacement fluid.

The day before admission, he had suffered from vomiting, dehydration, and decreased physical activity. His urine was dark-coloured. The next morning, he was very pale and mildly icteric. A physical examination did not reveal any organomegaly. Initial investigations showed severe anaemia (haemoglobin 6.5 g/dl), leukocytosis (WBC 29.050/mm3), normal platelet count (PLT 277.000/mm3), and increased CRP (11.9 mg/dl; normal range < 1.0 mg/dl). Other results were as follows: procalcitonin 44.4 ng/ml, serum bilirubin 104 \u03bcmol/l with the indirect fraction of 95 \u03bcmol/l, blood urea 148 mg/dl, and serum creatinine 0.64 mg/dl. Because of suspected haemolytic uraemic syndrome, the boy was transferred to the Department of Nephrology. On admission, at a physical examination, he was pale and dehydrated (about 8%), blood pressure was 99/51 mmHg, heart rate was 138 bpm, saturation was 91% SiO2, temperature was 37,8oC, the urine was dark brown, and diuresis was 300 ml/day. As an initial treatment, he immediately received boluses of normal saline and cefotaxime (300 mg/kg/day in three doses, intravenously). The first blood samples were also examined for the ABO/Rh type and screened for antibodies. The blood type was AB RhD plus. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for complement, with a C3c and C3d specificity, and IgG was negative. Warm haemolysins were detected. At the onset, laboratory tests were performed on: urine (proteinuria 400 mg/dl, haemoglobinuria, and 1-3 erythrocytes per view field) and whole blood (haemoglobin 4.6 g/dl, Ht 11.5%, RBC 1.37 million/mm3, platelet count 241,000/mm3, WBC 20,800/mm3, with 59% of neutrophils, and reticulocyte count 19.8\u2030). The blood smear showed anisopoikilocytosis, RBC agglutination, and polychromasia. Other results were as follows: CRP 5.8 mg/dl, procalcitonin 40 ng/ml, GOT 148 U/l, GPT 20 U/l, bilirubin 95.7 \u03bcmol/l, LDH 8525 U/l, urea 137 mg/dl, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, GFR 43.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (grade 2 AKI according to the criteria of Acute Kindey Injury Network []), uric acid 6.5 mg/dl, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 5.1 mEq/l, calcium 4.7 mEq/l, phosphorus 3.6 mEq/l, arterial blood gases were: pH 7.42, HCO3 21.8 mmol/l, BE (\u20133.9) mmol/l, pO2 67 mmHg, pCO2 66 mmHg, C3 83 mg/dl, C4 8.0 mg/dl, IgA, IgG, IgM were normal, and ANA, ANCA were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography showed normal-sized, hyperechogenic kidneys. The liver and spleen were of normal size. ECG and chest X-ray were unremarkable.\\nThese results suggested intravascular haemolysis with AKI. The boy was kept in a warm hospital room (room temperature 26oC), with a cap on his head. He was hydrated intravenously and orally. All intravenous infusions were given through a heating apparatus. Due to the low Hb of 4.3 g/dl, he was transfused with packed red blood cells, and the post-transfusion Hb was 9.5 g/dl. Steroids started to be administered intravenously on the first day (1.5 mg/kg/day). Because of two episodes of Hb decreasing to 7.0 g/dl, the boy was transfused with filtered red blood cells. Although warm haemolysins were detected, the clinical presentation resembled cold AIHA. Therefore, serologic tests were repeated. On the third day of hospitalisation, the DL test confirmed the presence of DL antibodies, and PCH was diagnosed. We continued the treatment with corticosteroids (2 mg/kg/day for seven days), gradually decreasing the dose, Sandoglobulin P (a total dose of 18 \u03b3 in three days) and cefotaxime for 10 days. After 10 days of treatment, laboratory tests showed: creatinine 0.3 mg/dl, urea 24 mg/dl, uric acid 4.0 mg/dl, Hb 8.4 g/dl, reticulocytes 91%, bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl, GOT 32 U/l, LDH 1163 U/l, and normal urinalysis.",

Prior to diagnosis, patient was healthy, with no significant birth history and no history of surgery, trauma, or blood transfusion. The patient visited the local clinic due to cold/flu-like symptoms, swelling eyelids and lower limbs, and abdominal pain that was eventually diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome. No family history was reported. Based on the records provided by the patient's parents, the patient underwent a course of oral corticosteroid, and subsequently, urine protein was negative, indicating corticosteroid-sensitive response. However, patient's urine protein increased once again after tapering corticosteroid, and her steroid dosage was increased. Subsequently, her urinalysis was once again negative for protein, but each time steroid taper was attempted, patient relapsed with significant proteinuria. Although her disease was progressively steroid dependent, corticosteroid was discontinued per the request of the patient's parents after several courses due to concern for adverse effects of long-term therapy. Instead, the patient was switched to traditional Chinese medicine (ingredients unknown) for nearly 4 months (). During the treatment with traditional Chinese medicine alone, the patient visited her local primary care clinic for several urinalyses that consistently demonstrated 3+ proteinuria and occult blood. Meanwhile, the patient showed progressive clinical decline with severe complications including urinary tract infections, systemic edema, shortness of breath, frequent urination, and dysuria. Due to significant disease progression, patient was referred to our hospital in March 2018.\\nOn presentation to our hospital, the patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and found to have a fungal infection, heart failure, hypertension, ascites, and persistent oliguria.

Blood was collected and the laboratory findings were analyzed periodically ().\\nLaboratory features upon admission revealed a very prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), i.e., blood was uncoagulable, the platelets count wad normal and serum creatinine was slightly elevated (1.6 mg/dL; RV< 1.3 mg/dL). Four vials of specific antivenom (Anti Bothropic Serum \u2013 a polyvalent serum of equine origin, F(ab)2, against Bothrops species, 10 mL/vial, manufactured by Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were administered without any anaphylactic reaction. However, the patient evolved with increasing serum creatinine (sCr) levels (2.9 mg/dL; RV < 1.3 mg/dL) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was decreasing (eGFR 23 mL/min/1.73m2; RV > 60 mL/min/1.73m2). Therefore, antivenom therapy was reinforced with 8 more vials, completing the protocol for a severe accident. On the following days, he presented AKI (sCre 5.4 mg/dL; eGFR 12.5 mL/min/1.73m2), thrombocytopenia (31.000/mm3; RV: 150.000-450.000/mm3), anemia (hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL; RV: 13.5-17 g/dL), normal coagulation assays, presence of hemoglobin, protein and waxy casts in the urine, slight increase in serum indirect bilirubin levels ( /dL; RV\u2264 0.8mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase elevation (LDH=3,805 U/L; RV: 230-460 U/L) and presence of schizocytes in peripheral blood (). From the sixth dayof hospitalization, the patient exhibited significant improvement. Renal replacement therapy and plasmapheresis were not required, and the patient was discharged with a partial recovery of renal function on the eighth day after the snakebite (sCr 2.5 mg/dL; eGFR 31.8 mL/min/1.73 m2). Four days after hospital discharge, days he returned to the hospital and underwent further laboratory tests that showed improvement in renal function (sCr 1.8 mg/dL).",

Heart failure medical therapy was optimized and included beta-blockade. A prior trial of sotalol therapy provided no arrhythmia suppression.

Transvenous catheter VT ablation was attempted however the arrhythmia recurred a month later.\\nOn presentation, the patient had recurrent VT at 215 beats per minute. 12-lead electrocardiography revealed a monomorphic wide complex tachycardia with left bundle branch block like morphology, inferior axis, and late precordial transition. His arrhythmia precipitated frequent appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator anti-tachycardia pacing and shocks therapies. There was no evidence of ongoing reversible myocardial ischemia or metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities.\\nGiven his severe biventricular failure, prior sotalol and mexilitine failure, and drug-toxicities with amiodarone, antiarrhythmic options were limited.

        "note": "A 26-year-old man presented to the emergency department in a state of collapse. One month prior to the current admission he was seen by a urologist with frank haematuria associated with colicky abdominal pain, increased urinary frequency and dysuria. Although he was initially treated for a urinary tract infection a CT abdomen demonstrated moderate bilateral hydronephrosis. No cause for the hydronephrosis was seen, in particular no calculi. Common bile duct (CBD) was measured at 8 mm. Cystoscopy revealed a diffusely inflamed bladder with marked reduction in capacity (150 cc) but no obstruction at the ureteric orifices. The bladder biopsy showed inflammatory change but no dysplasia or malignancy. No firm diagnosis was reached and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up.\\nFor 4 days prior to the current admission the patient had been unwell with increasing flank pain, but had become drowsy and short of breath. On arrival, blood pressure was low at 95/60 mmHg with an associated tachycardia (140 bpm, sinus rhythm) and tachypnoea (60 breaths/min). The Glasgow coma scale was 13/15 with no localizing neurological signs. Initial investigations revealed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.2, bicarbonate 6.4 mmol/l, pO2 39.3 kPa, pCO2 2.0 kPa) and acute renal failure (serum potassium 5.4 mmol/l, urea 36.7 mmol/l, creatinine 851 \u03bcmol/l). Liver function tests were abnormal with an obstructive pattern (serum bilirubin 58 \u03bcmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 294 IU/l, alanine transaminase 106 IU/l, \u03b3GT 1045 IU/l). Further history revealed that the patient was a regular user of street ketamine intra-nasally for the past 2 years.\\nAfter initial assessment, patient deteriorated quickly with worsening respiratory function requiring intubation. The chest radiograph revealed bilateral basal consolidation consistent with aspiration. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and vasopressors were required. Continuous haemofiltration (CVVH) and broad-spectrum antibiotics were commenced; blood cultures subsequently grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. A repeat renal ultrasound confirmed hydronephrosis, and bilateral nephrostomies were placed, although the opening pressures were less than expected. Gelatinous debris was aspirated and was present throughout both pelvicalyceal systems, and in the left ureter; this did not have typical appearances of blood clots (Figure ). Subsequent analysis of this material demonstrated the presence of ketamine metabolites, cannabanoids and lignocaine. A dilated CBD was also observed on ultrasound.\\nUrine output began to return by Day 2 and bilateral nephrostograms showed free flow of contrast to the bladder with no obstruction. Despite this, CVVH then intermittent dialysis was required until Day 24 when renal function began to recover. Nephrostomies were clamped and then removed, and at discharge serum creatinine was 123 \u03bcmol/l. A follow-up ultrasound revealed that the hydronephrosis had completely resolved.\\nLiver function tests improved spontaneously, and repeat scanning also confirmed resolution of CBD dilatation. The patient required several weeks of rehabilitation and nutritional support following discharge from ITU but had made a full recovery at the point of discharge.\\nUnfortunately, the patient was readmitted 6 weeks later with right upper quadrant pain and marked derangement of liver function tests (serum bilirubin 7 \u03bcmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 1503 IU/l, alanine transaminase 482 IU/l, \u03b3GT 561 IU/l). A repeat ultrasound showed that the biliary dilatation had recurred but that the renal tract appeared normal. Serum creatinine had risen again to 294 \u03bcmol/l. Urine analysis was positive for ketamine metabolites but negative for other illicit drugs, proving that the patient was abusing this drug again. He was treated for biliary sepsis with improvement of symptoms and subsequently underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). No strictures or stones were seen in the CBD, and a stent was placed. Unfortunately, the patient developed pancreatitis post-procedure. Eight weeks subsequent to this, liver function tests had only partially improved (serum bilirubin 21 \u03bcmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 770 IU/l, alanine transaminase 326 IU/l, \u03b3GT 1554 IU/l), and after initial improvement, serum creatinine had risen to 309 \u03bcmol/l.",

        "note": "A 62-year-old female patient was referred to the nephrology unit for asymptomatic urinary abnormalities including microscopic hematuria and proteinuria, which had persisted for a year. The patient also complained of general weakness and mild dyspnea during exercise. Two years earlier, the patient had undergone mitral valve repair surgery for mitral regurgitation (MR) and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with artificial chordae and an annuloplasty rings (Fig. A). During the current visit, the patient showed a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate 65/min, respiration rate 22/min, and body temperature 36.5\u00b0C. Other than hyperthyroidism, she had no significant medical history such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or kidney disease; she also had no episodes of gross hematuria. Physical examination revealed conjunctival pallor but no evidence of jaundice in the sclerae. Moreover, there was no evidence of intra-abdominal organomegaly or edema of the lower limbs. Chest auscultation indicated regular heart sounds, with a holosystolic murmur (Grade IV/VI) in the apex region. A peripheral blood test at admission revealed the following: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4300/\u03bcL (neutrophils 59%); hemoglobin (Hb), 8.9 g/dL; and platelet count, 227,000/\u03bcL. Serum biochemical examination revealed the following: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 24.1 mg/dL; creatinine (Cr), 0.8 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR; 79 mL/min/1.73m2); aspartate aminotransferase, 55 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 16 IU/L; total protein, 6.8 g/dL; serum albumin, 4.3 g/dL; and C-reactive protein, 0.6 mg/L. Anemia-related hematological test results are described in Table . Urinalysis results were as follows: pH 5.5, occult blood 2+, and albumin 2+. Microscopic urinary sediment evaluation revealed 1\u20133 WBCs per high-power field (HPF) and 10\u201330 red blood cells (RBCs) per HPF (dysmorphic 80%). Twenty-four-hour urine examination revealed a urine protein level of 375 mg/day and a Cr clearance of 76.7 mL/min/1.73 m2. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, including IgG, IgA, and IgM, were normal, whereas the serum complement 3 (C3) level was reduced (67.2 mg/dL; normal range, 90\u2013180 mg/dL); the levels of C4 and 50% hemolyzing dose of complement were normal. Moreover, serological test results for rheumatoid factor, viral markers (hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody), lupus studies (antinuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA antibody), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and cryoglobulin were negative. On the chest radiograph, there were no abnormal findings, except for a slight cardiomegaly. The size and shape of both kidneys were normal on renal ultrasonography, whereas peripheral blood smear showed normocytic normochromic anemia with polychromasia, poikilocytosis, schistocytes, and spherocytes, suggesting hemolytic anemia (Fig. ). PNH was excluded based on negative results of the flow cytometry tests for percentages of CD59+ cells and CD55+ cells among RBCs and granulocytes. Consequently, we suspected an asymptomatic urinary abnormality and performed a percutaneous renal biopsy on the third day after admission, to rule out glomerulopathy associated with a systemic disease. The renal biopsy showed 2 global glomerulosclerosis in all 23 glomeruli. The other glomeruli did not show significant pathologic abnormalities such as endocapillary proliferation, crescents or intravascular fibrin thrombi. However, interstitium showed extensive deposition of coarsely granular pigments mostly in tubular epithelial cells and within the tubular lumen on hematoxylin and eosin stains (Fig. A and B). Prussian blue iron stain demonstrated marked renal hemosiderosis with extensive iron depositions in the tubules (Fig. C and D). Immunofluorescence studies did not show any immune deposits in glomeruli. Electron microscopy showed unremarkable glomerular structure with no electron-dense deposits in the mesangium and along the capillary walls (Fig. A). However, irregularly shaped electron-dense particles were found within the lysosomes in tubules, particular in proximal tubular epithelial cells (Fig. B). Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the seventh day after admission showed moderate MR, which was due to tethering of the posterior leaflet. However, unlike in an MR due to typical posterior leaflet tethering, the direction of regurgitant blood flow was anterior, due to the blood striking the annuloplasty ring (Fig. B). On the basis of the laboratory and renal biopsy findings, the patient was diagnosed with chronic intravascular hemolysis and renal hemosiderosis following mitral valve repair. Subsequently, we recommended a mitral valve repeat surgery, but the patient refused surgery. We initiated a treatment regimen that included daily oral administration of ferrous sulfate 160 mg/day, N-acetylcysteine 200 mg/day, and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/day. Concentrated RBC transfusion was not performed. At 24 months after the kidney biopsy, renal function remained stable with biochemical test results showing BUN level of 19.4 mg/dL and Cr level of 0.9 mg/dL; however, clinical signs of hemolytic anemia persisted (Table ). Urinalysis results showed albumin 1+, RBC 5\u201310/HPF, and random urine protein-Cr ratio of 215 mg/g, which represented no significant differences compared to the results seen during the renal biopsy.",

Patient also reported a decrease in urine output and bilateral ankle swelling that had been worsening over the past 2 weeks. He had no history of recent travel, sick contacts or blood transfusion. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage III, gout, and COPD. He had no allergies. He had quit smoking 9 years ago, did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.\\nThe patient was hospitalized for pneumonia 3 weeks before presentation, and was treated with intravenous cefazolin for 2 weeks for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. On examination, the patient was tachypneic (respiratory rate 25/min), temperature 97.6\u00b0F, blood pressure 155/71, pulse 109 bpm, with a saturation of 99% on 3 liters via nasal cannula. The skin and conjunctiva were pale. There were bibasilar rales in the lungs and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema 2+; the remainder of the examination was normal.\\nElectrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST segment and T wave abnormalities. Chest radiograph showed bibasilar opacifications and bilateral pleural effusions. Furosemide was administered intravenously, sublingual nitroglycerin, and oral aspirin were given. Blood work was significant for hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL (baseline 10), creatinine of 9.2 mg/dL (baseline of 1.67), troponin of 0.6 and albumin 2.6 g/dL. Lower extremity duplex study showed right peroneal deep vein thrombosis and heparin infusion was initiated for possible pulmonary embolism and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In addition, broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) were initiated empirically. Urinalysis showed large blood, and red blood cell (RBC) casts were seen on light microscopy. Sputum staining showed epithelial cells and few white blood cells.\\nTransthoracic echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, with moderate mitral regurgitation and a small pericardial effusion. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed bilateral renal echogenicity, compatible with renal disease. The right kidney was measured to be 10 cm in length by 4.4 cm in width by 4.4 cm anteroposterior diameter. The left kidney measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm by 4.9 cm. Vascular flow was demonstrated within each kidney. Serology workup for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) was sent.\\nOn day 2 of the hospitalization, the patient became more tachypneic and fatigued necessitating oxygen supplementation with bi-level positive airway pressure. He was anuric (urine output 100 cc/24 hours) and was started on hemodialysis for hypervolemia; blood and urine cultures were negative. The patient had acute drop in hemoglobin (7 g/dL); heparin was stopped and he remained on acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. On day 4, the patient was started on pulse steroids Solu-Medrol 1 g daily for 3 days. Patient\u2019s condition and thrombocytopenia had precluded kidney biopsy up to this point. On day 6, sputum culture showed heavy growth of Klebsiella oxytoca.\\nRapidly progressive GN workup: hepatitis viral panel was negative. Hematological and immunological workup was normal including antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, anticardiolipin IgG and IgM, cryoglobulin, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (proteinase-3 AB <1.0, myeloperox AB <1.0), C3 and C4. Serum protein electrophoresis showed polyclonal gammopathy (gamma fraction 2.2 g). Rheumatoid factor titers were elevated 45 H (<14); elevated free kappa and lambda serum with normal ratio (1) (free kappa serum 205.8 mg/L [3.3\u201319.4], free lambda serum 205.0 mg/L [5.7\u201326.3]).",

There was no perinatal resuscitation and antenatal history was unremarkable. On her second day of life, she had multiple generalised tonic\u2013clonic convulsions. The patient had 16 year old brother who is presently alive and well. Two siblings died as infants; the first died at 3 weeks of age and had an encephalocoele. The other sibling died at 9 months of age and had an encephalocoele and hydrocephalus for which a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted.\\nOn examination she was noted to have generalised hypotonia with a flat nasal bridge, abnormal eye movements and both anterior and posterior fontanelles were enlarged. MRI brain done at 56 days of age showed a small dysplastic vermis, large rounded superior cerebellar peduncles and absence of decussation of white matter pathways forming the \u2018molar tooth\u2019 malformation, characteristic of JS (Fig. ). The fourth ventricle was enlarged; there was ventricular asymmetry and dilatation with absence of septum pellucidum and a midline lipoma in the occipital region. Oral phenobarbital and phenytoin were commenced after which no further convulsions were noted. She was followed up by a paediatric neurologist until 2 years of age at which point she was lost to follow up.\\nShe presented several years later, age 7 years, for a general outpatient review. She was not on any medication and had reportedly been seizure free for several years. She had characteristic clinical features of JS, namely; gross developmental delay and cognitive impairment, hypotonia with abnormal limb movements and generalised muscle wasting, a wide nasal bridge, low set ears, a protruding tongue and abnormal eye movements. Her weight at this point was 17 kg and length 119 cm.

        "note": "A 59-yr-old woman who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus for 25 yr, suffered from recurrent severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness since October 2011. Her body weight was 52 kg and her body mass index (BMI) was 20.31 kg/m2. Fasting and postprandial serum C-peptide concentrations were 0.07 ng/mL and 0.23 ng/mL, respectively. She had visited the emergency room twice complaining of decreased consciousness related to severe hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) in the previous year. She did not experience hypoglycemic symptoms until her blood glucose level decreased to 50 mg/dL. Her total insulin requirement was 34 U/day, and her glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ranged from 7.8% to 9.6% with a mean value of 8.54% in the preceding 2 yr. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 91.67 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) was 16.45 mg/g. An ophthalmological evaluation showed mild nonproliferative retinopathy of both eyes. There was no evidence of macrovascular complication.\\nThe pancreas was procured from a 49-yr-old brain-death donor with a BMI of 23.13 kg/m2. The organ was transported in chilled histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution and transferred to the Good Manufacturing Practice facility. The pancreas was distended by controlled ductal perfusion with Liberase human islet enzyme (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, USA) and digested mechanically in a Ricordi chamber. Pancreatic tissue density was tested before purification using a COBE 2991 cell processor (Gambro BCT Inc., Lakewood, CO, USA) to predict the pancreatic tissue density. Prepurification gradient tests were performed using a Ficoll (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany)-based standard gradient (1.100-1.077 g/cm3), OptiPrep (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)-based gradient-1 (1.100-1.085-1.060 g/cm3) and OptiPrep-based gradient-2 (1.090-1.075-1.050 g/cm3). The tests showed little differences in the density and produced a single layer of islet-acinar cell mixture. By contrast, a gradient test using OptiPrep-based gradient-3 (1.080-1.065-1.040 g/cm3) produced two distinct layers of the different cell types. Islet purification using the COBE was performed using the gradient-3 combination with OptiPrep solution. The total amount of purified islets was 216,500 islet equivalents (IEQ) (4,163 IEQ/recipient body weight in kg), which is the minimally adequate quantity for transplantation (). The purity of the isolated islets was 79.6%, and the islet viability was >90%. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion of isolated islet was tested in vitro and showed an insulin concentration of 10.1 \u00b5U/mL at low (2.8 mM) glucose media and 17.1 \u00b5U/mL at high (16.8 mM) glucose media during 1 hr each. Gram staining of the media was negative, and the endotoxin concentration was <1EU/kg.\\nThe islet transplantation was performed in November 2013. The patient was sedated and a percutaneous transhepatic approach was used to access to the portal vein under fluoroscopic guidance. The portal venous pressure was measured at baseline and after islet infusion. Doppler ultrasonography of the portal vein was performed within 24 hr after transplantation, and no definite evidence of flow disturbance was observed. The immunosuppressive regimen was based on that previously described in the Edmonton protocol (). Instead of daclizumab, basiliximab was given intravenously at a dose of 20 mg 2 hr before islet transplantation and 4 days after transplantation. Sirolimus was administered administered once daily to achieve a target trough therapeutic range of 12-15 ng/mL for the first 3 months, after which the target trough range was planned to be lowered to 7-12 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was administered twice daily and adjusted to achieve a target trough level of 3-6 ng/mL. One month after transplantation, the dosage of sirolimus was reduced because of systemic mucositis and leukopenia, and this dosage was maintained at the trough level of 5-9 ng/mL. The islet transplantation protocol was approved by the institutional review board of The Catholic University of Korea (No. KC10CISI0438) and written informed consent was obtained from the patient. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.\\nAfter islet transplantation, the patient's insulin requirement decreased to 22 U/day, which was about 65% of the previous requirement (). Fasting and postprandial C-peptide concentrations improved to 0.25 ng/mL and 0.44 ng/mL, respectively, at 2 months after transplantation. The HbA1c level improved to 7.3% at 3 months after transplantation. Self-monitored blood glucose concentration was measured four times a day (before each meal and at bedtime), and the results showed marked improvement in the frequencies of both hypoglycemia and extreme hyperglycemia after transplantation (). Before transplantation, she experienced severe hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) on average twice a month. However, she did not experience further severe hypoglycemia and became aware of hypoglycemia at a glucose concentration of 70 mg/dL. We calculated the Glycemic Risk Assessment Diabetes Equation (GRADE) score to assess the glycemic variability and the percentage contribution of hypoglycemia events, before and at 3 and 9 months after the transplantation (). Also the Average Daily Risk Range (ADRR) index was calculated; the values are stratified into three categories: low risk <20; moderate risk, 20-\u226440; and high risk >40 (, ). Before the transplantation, the GRADE score was 10.31 with 28.5% of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) events, and improved to GRADE score of 7.94 with 2.4% of hypoglycemia events and 5.99 with 2.1% of hypoglycemia events at 3 and 9 months after the transplantation, respectively. Similarly, the ADRR index was 26.88 before the transplantation and improved to 17.56 and 14.60 at 3 and 9 months after transplantation, respectively. Currently (about 9 months after the transplantation), her HbA1c is 7.8%, and fasting and postprandial C-peptide concentrations are 0.20 and 0.43 ng/mL, respectively. There is no evidence of leukopenia.",

        "note": "A 30-year-old white man was brought to our emergency department by the police under the Mental Health Act in an aggressive and combative state threatening suicide and homicide. His presentation was precipitated by daily cannabis use and multiple binges of ice over the prior month. His past psychiatric history included childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizoaffective disorder which was managed on a Community Treatment Order with fortnightly 300 mg zuclopenthixol decanoate intramuscular injections. His past medical history was remarkable for polysubstance abuse. From 15 years of age he regularly used tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, and sporadically used heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy, and amphetamines. In terms of family history, his father had ADHD and one historical episode of manic psychotic illness requiring treatment with medication and electroconvulsive therapy. His male sibling was deceased from suicide after protracted illness with major depression and binge eating disorder. Our patient had a long history of transient living and difficulty sustaining regular employment in bricklaying. At the time of presentation, he was living in a shared residence and using ice most days in the context of interpersonal conflict, unemployment, financial stressors, and housing stressors.\\nOn his arrival at our emergency department, six-point mechanical restraint was required for his safety and for the safety of the staff and co-patients. An initial physical examination revealed Glasgow Coma Score of 14 (Eyes 4, Voice 4, Motor 6), tachycardic pulse 110 beats/minute, blood pressure 125/63 mmHg, fingertip oxygen saturation 95 % on room air, and tympanic temperature 36.1 \u00b0C. A subsequent physical examination revealed that his pupils were equal and reactive to light, heart sounds were dual with nil added sounds or murmurs, chest auscultation was normal bilaterally, abdomen was soft and non-tender, and upper and lower limbs were neurologically intact based on gross examination. An electrocardiogram could not be recorded due to his combative behavior. He claimed that he had been stabbed in the torso by his flatmate despite no evidence of any external injuries. A full blood examination, C-reactive protein test, random blood glucose test, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and ethanol level were unremarkable. Renal function tests revealed mild hypokalemia, his potassium (K+) was 3.2, and mild acute kidney injury, his creatinine was 126.",

        "note": "A 50 year-old woman was admitted in our hospital for abdominal pain and massive vaginal haemorrhage. She was at day 9 post-partum, following a non-complicated elective caesarean section after unsuccessful birth induction. This event occurred after a 41 weeks normal gestation resulting from oocyte donation for infertility due to physiological ovarian aging. At admission, blood pressure was maintained at 129/91 mmHg despite massive bleeding. Haemoglobin was 93 g/L with a normal thrombocyte count. She rapidly underwent two uterine curettages followed by embolization of uterine arteries. Treatment also included amines, oxytocine, sulprostone, 2 g of tranexamic acid (TXA), 5 units of packed red blood cells (RBC), 1 unit of platelets, 2 units of frozen plasma and 2 g of fibrinogen for consumption coagulopathy. At Intensive Care Unit admission, serum creatinine was increased to 116 \u03bcmol/L and platelet count was decreased to 102 G/L. Due to persistent uncontrolled bleeding, she underwent total hysterectomy, with the administration of 7 additional RBCs and 500 mcg of TXA. Total blood loss was estimated to 2700 mL. Anatomopathological analysis of surgical tissues excluded signs of endometritis. In the recovery room, she developed symptomatic high blood pressure associated with blurred vision, dizziness, headache and hyperreflexia necessitating intravenous labetalol. Despite bleeding control and coagulation markers\u2019 normalization, haemoglobin, platelet count and kidney function continued to worsen, subsequently leading to AKI stage 3 associated with dysmorphic microhematuria and proteinuria up to 2 g/day with the need of replacement therapy. Blood tests showed numerous schizocytes (49\u2030) with undetectable haptoglobin (< 0.1 g/L) and massive lactate dehydrogenase (LDH 1340 UI/L) levels, clearly defining signs of TMA. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was reasonably ruled out due to a normal fibrinogen level. ADAMTS-13 activity was normal at 38%, although the essay was performed just after the administration of the 2 initial fresh frozen plasma packs. C3 was reduced to 0.63 g/L with markedly increased serum sC5b-9 and Bb factors, respectively to 637 ng/ml (normal range 127\u2013303 ng/mL) and 5.95 \u03bcg/mL (normal range < 1.65 \u03bcg/mL). Moreover, a serum C3 splitting activity was found giving rise to C3c. Factor H (FH) was normal and Factor I (FI) was slightly but not significantly reduced to 36.2 \u03bcg/mL (normal range 38\u201358 \u03bcg/mL), probably due to consumption. No anti-FH antibody was detected (Table ). The marked activation of complement alternative and terminal pathways prompted us to start anti-C5 therapy, i.e. intravenous eculizumab 900 mg, once weekly, with the required antibiotic prophylaxis and meningococcal vaccination. Interestingly, sC5b-9 normalized within 12 h after the first dose of eculizumab, factor Bb and C3 after seven days, platelet count after nine days and haptoglobin after 3 weeks. The clinical picture improved rapidly with blood pressure control after 48 h and diuresis resumed after three days. Weekly eculizumab was continued aiming a CH50 below 10%. The patient received a total of six doses of eculizumab over two months, until haemodialysis could be discontinued (Fig. ). Using Next-Generation Sequencing, no complement genetic abnormality in favour of p-aHUS was detected. Two years after admission, the patient was doing well. Serum creatinine was 82 \u03bcmol/l.",

        "note": "A 30-year-old woman visited the nephrology clinic because of proteinuria and hematuria. The patient presented with generalized edema, and her urine had been foamy for 2 months. Her medical history was unremarkable. Her blood pressure was 112/60 mmHg, and pitting edema was observed during her physical examination. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed that both kidneys had a normal size and echogenicity. In our initial laboratory tests, the following values were found: hemoglobin level, 11.6 g/dL; platelet count, 322 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL; total protein level, 5.1 g/dL; serum albumin level, 2.01 g/dL; serum creatinine level, 1.14 mg/dL (corresponding to an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 64.9 mL/min/1.73 m2); and total cholesterol level, 395 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (2+) and hematuria (2+; red blood cell count, > 20/high-power field). The spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) was 7.32 g/g, and the spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 5.24 g/g, with nonselective glomerular proteinuria detected by urine electrophoresis. The results of other serological tests were positive for the antinuclear antibody (1:160), and negative for a speckled pattern and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA); additionally, her serum complements were within their reference ranges. All viral serological markers were negative. Kidney biopsy was performed. Twenty of 30 glomeruli showed cellular or fibrocellular crescents with mesangial proliferation. There was focal mild to moderate acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration with mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, mainly along the crescentic glomeruli. There was occasional fibrinoid necrosis in the crescentic glomeruli, but there was no vasculitis in the interstitium. Some glomeruli showing mesangial proliferation or segmental sclerotic change without fibrinoid necrosis were observed. The immunofluorescent study revealed diffuse global immunofluorescent activity for IgM (1+), immunoglobulin G (IgG) (trace), and complement 3 (C3) (trace) in the mesangium. The corresponding electron-dense deposit was confirmed by the electron microscopic (EM) examination (Fig. ). A diagnosis of immune complex-mediated crescentic GN, possibly IgM nephropathy, was made.\\nAs a treatment regimen for crescentic GN, three pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone (750 mg/day) were administered, followed by daily oral prednisone and intravenous cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). Her serum creatinine level continuously increased to 1.66 mg/dL (eGFR, 36.5 ml/min/1.73 m2) after admission and then decreased to 1.09 mg/dL (eGFR, 59.3 ml/min/1.73 m2) when she was discharged on the eighth day of admission. Three months later, her serum creatinine level was stabilized at 1.11 mg/dL (eGFR, 57.7 ml/min/1.73 m2), and microscopic hematuria completely disappeared. However, she steadily complained of generalized edema, and considerable nephrotic-range proteinuria persisted at a spot urine UPCR of 7.73 g/g. Given the tendency of resistance to cyclophosphamide treatments, rituximab was administered intravenously (375 mg/m2 per week) for 4 weeks alternatively. After the first dose of rituximab, her UPCR decreased to 0.27 g/g. However, after 4 weeks of rituximab therapy, the UPCR increased again to 5.59 g/g.\\nA second kidney biopsy was performed to make a precise diagnosis and to evaluate the change in glomeruli after the former treatment. Ten of 13 glomeruli showed segmental sclerosis with occasional mesangial proliferation, and most of them showed fibrous crescents. Mild interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy and minimal lymphoplasma cell infiltration were found. Diffuse global immunofluorescent activities for IgM (1+), IgG (trace), and C3 (trace) were observed, with electron-dense deposits in the mesangium, like in the first biopsy (Fig. ). A diagnosis of IgM nephropathy with a resolving phase of crescentic GN was made. After the second renal biopsy, cyclosporine was administered to treat the nephrotic-range proteinuria, and the UPCR in a spot urine sample decreased from 5.59 g/g to 2.24 g/g. The patient also reported an improvement in edema. Two months after the cyclosporine therapy, the serum creatinine level was 1.37 mg/d.",

        "note": "The donor was a 63-year-old female patient with end-stage bilateral heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease, considered for listing for heart transplantation. The patient met all indication criteria, apart from an exceedingly high fixed pulmonary hypertension. A biventricular pulsatile assist device (Thoratec PVAD, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) was implanted in a biventricular fashion in order to reduce the pulmonary resistance to measures matching the criteria for subsequent heart transplantation. Anticoagulation therapy, required due to the implanted mechanical circulatory support (MCS), was established with warfarin (INR 2.0\u20132.5). The patient's previously deteriorated renal function improved after biventricular assist device implantation (serum creatinine 1.87 mg/dL \u2192 0.97 mg/dL and GFR 29 mL/min \u2192 62 mL/min). Thirty-five days after surgery, the patient complained of a sudden onset of severe headache and coma rapidly developed. Despite a moderate level of anticoagulation at the time of the event (INR 2.1), CT scan verified a vast haemorrhagic stroke in the left cerebral hemisphere with propagation to the cerebral ventricular system and malignant brain oedema. In view of the lethal neurological prognosis, organ donation was taken into consideration, as the patient had a relatively well-preserved function of other organs because of adequate circulatory perfusion. Having received negative brain perfusion at the angiography, after laparatomy and perfusion with 2000 mL of UW solution, a bilateral transabdominal nephrectomy was performed and the kidneys were shown to be suitable for transplantation. The MCS was maintained for the duration of the kidney procurement and thus the procedure was performed under the same conditions as a normal beating heart. At that time, the patient's kidney function was satisfactory (Cr 0.97 mg/dL, GFR 62 mL/min). The backtable wedge kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis along with mild benign nephrosclerosis with focal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy of both kidneys (). The allocation of these kidneys to recipients over 60 years old was suggested. Prior to surgery, both kidney transplant recipients were informed about the possible limitations and signed informed consent.\\nThe recipient of the left kidney was a 62-year-old female with end-stage renal failure due to tubulointerstitial nephritis, who had undergone chronic haemodialysis therapy for 2 years. The surgery was complicated with the external iliac endarterectomy. Since acute tubular necrosis was suspected, a polyclonal antithymocyte globuline single shot (ATG-Fresenius S, Fresenius Biotech GmbH, Grafelfing, Germany, 9 mg/kg) prior to reperfusion was given, followed by mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. Cyclosporine A was delayed until Day 6. On Day 14, a renal biopsy was performed () that confirmed mild regenerating acute tubular necrosis and transfer of mild benign nephrosclerosis without any evidence of acute rejection. The patient was discharged on Day 16 with stable renal function (Cr 2.17 mg/dL, GFR 24 mL/min).\\nThree months after transplantation, a routine protocol biopsy was performed. Light microscopy demonstrated normal histological findings (). Twelve months after transplantation, the patient's kidney function remains stable (Cr 1.88 mg/dL).",

        "note": "A Hispanic man in his early 20s had precursor B-cell ALL diagnosed at 17 years of age. During his initial chemotherapy, nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis was documented on liver biopsy, which prompted a reduction in chemotherapy. Eight months after completion of chemotherapy, his B-cell ALL relapsed with blasts expressing CD19, CD20, and CD22 antigens. He did not achieve remission with re-induction chemotherapy and was not eligible for bone marrow transplantation due to liver cirrhosis, so we proceeded with CAR-T cell therapy. Three doses of CAR-T cells were generated, each one containing 1.5 \u00d7108 (1.5 \u00d7106 per kg) autologous CD19 CAR-T cells (tisagenlecleucel [Kymriah]; Novartis Pharmaceuticals).\\nThe patient received 2 CAR-T cell infusions preceded by lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The second infusion was administered 2.5 months after the first one due to loss of B-cell aplasia. He did not receive any steroids during the 2 initial CAR-T cell treatments. He tolerated the first and second infusions well without cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or other complications.\\nTwo months after the second infusion, relapse was diagnosed (16% blasts that were still CD19 positive). In discussion with CAR-T experts and due to lack of other treatment options, he received the third CAR-T infusion 5 months after the first infusion. Four days postinfusion, he developed grade 2 cytokine release syndrome, manifested by fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia with profound elevation in serum interleukin 6 (IL-6; peak, >1,500 pg/mL; normal, <6 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (peak, 65.12 mg/L), prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (peak, 15.8 seconds and 1.4), partial thromboplastin time (peak, 114 seconds), ferritin (peak, 21,028 ng/mL), and D-dimer (>20 \u03bcg/mL) values. Soluble IL-2 receptor \u03b1 was not measured. There was pancytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, and evidence of mild tumor lysis syndrome, but no neurotoxicity. He was managed with intravenous hydration, antibiotics, and allopurinol. Two doses of 800 mg of tocilizumab intravenously were administered on day 6 after the third CAR-T therapy, with resolution of clinical signs and marked improvement in levels of the inflammatory markers of cytokine release syndrome within a week after tocilizumab therapy. Corticosteroids were not used.\\nA week after the third CAR-T therapy, the patient developed new-onset nephrotic-range proteinuria with random urinary protein-creatinine ratio reaching up to 60 mg/mg (normal, <0.2 mg/mg). There was no hematuria. There was oliguria, anasarca, and interval weight gain of 12 kg (13% of body weight). Serum albumin levels mostly varied between 1.5 and 2 g/dL. This was consistent with a new-onset nephrotic syndrome. Liver enzyme levels were normal despite the presence of nodular cirrhosis on a sonogram. There was no portal hypertension on a Doppler ultrasound. There was splenomegaly. An echocardiogram showed normal cardiac anatomy. A kidney sonogram showed right kidney of 12.2 cm and left kidney of 12.7 cm in length with increased echogenicity and no hydronephrosis. There was marked hypogammaglobulinemia requiring intravenous immunoglobulin infusions.\\nSerum protein electrophoresis showed marked hypoglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia without any discrete spikes, including M spike. Urinary protein electrophoresis showed predominant albuminuria and absence of mono- or oligoclonal bands. Lupus serologic tests, HIV, parvovirus B19, and Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reaction, cryoglobulin, and hepatitis viral panel results were all negative. Nasopharyngeal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction was negative. Serum complement levels were normal. There was no history of herbal medication use. Nephrotic syndrome was managed with 25% albumin and furosemide infusions. Two weeks later, the patient's serum creatinine level started increasing from a baseline value of 0.52 to 0.75 mg/dL to a peak value of 2.02 mg/dL. The patient was not receiving other nephrotoxic agents.\\nKidney biopsy showed 17 glomeruli with mild mesangial expansion, glomerular margination of CD3-positive T lymphocytes, and global collapse of glomerular capillary loops with podocyte hyperplasia in 3 glomeruli (A-C). There was no tubular microcysts formation. There was mild diffuse interstitial inflammation, consisting of mainly CD3-positive lymphocytes and rare CD20-positive lymphocytes. Electron microscopy showed complete podocyte foot-process effacement (D). Bone marrow evaluation showed 66% lymphoblasts expressing CD19 antigen.\\nAs a salvage therapy, the patient received a 28-day course of a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager antibody construct (blinatumomab [Blincyto]; Amgen) that was started 6 weeks after the third CAR-T cell infusion This was again complicated by 2 more episodes of grade 2 cytokine release syndrome, requiring 3 additional doses of tocilizumab. Nephrotic syndrome persisted with mean random urinary protein-creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mg, but edema had resolved with diuresis. His serum creatinine level peaked at 2.91 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 27 mL/min/1.73 m2). Dialysis was not required. Due to persistent disease and absence of CD19 expression after 28 days of blinatumomab treatment, no further plans for targeted therapy were made. He was discharged home with a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL on treatment with spironolactone, losartan, statin, lactulose, vitamin K, and ursodiol. Eleven weeks after the third CAR-T cell therapy, he was started on a palliative chemotherapy consisting of a short course of oral steroid (40 mg twice daily for 10 days), vincristine, and 6-mercaptopurine. At the most recent outpatient follow-up visit 13 weeks after the third CAR-T infusion, serum creatinine and albumin levels were 2.10 mg/dL, and 3.8 g/dL, respectively. There was persistent but decreasing proteinuria with a random urinary protein-creatinine ratio of 6.5 mg/mg.",

        "note": "A 74-year-old Japanese woman with pSS accompanied by MGUS was admitted to our hospital due to progressive renal dysfunction and interstitial lung disease. The patient had no family history of renal diseases. She had been diagnosed as having pSS 16 years previously, based on the objectively confirmed presence of dry eyes, dry mouth and positivity for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies. Because she had no extraglandular organ involvement at that time, she had received local treatment for the ocular and oral symptoms. Four years after the diagnosis of pSS, bilateral lung reticular shadows were noticed in a radiological examination, along with elevation of the KL-6 titer. Although she was diagnosed as having interstitial lung disease-associated pSS based on the results of high-resolution computed tomography and bronchoalveolar lavage studies (increased lymphocytes without any findings suggestive of infection or malignancy), the reticular shadows and elevated serum KL-6 level improved spontaneously and no respiratory symptoms became evident, and therefore she had been followed up without steroid therapy. Six years before presentation, she had developed salivary gland swelling and was treated with prednisolone 10 mg daily in the short term, being maintained thereafter with low-dose prednisolone (2 mg daily). From 3 years before presentation, the serum level of IgA had gradually increased, along with a converse decrease of the serum IgG level. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated M-protein, and immunofixation revealed that the M-protein was the IgA-kappa type. The serum free light chain kappa/lambda ratio was also elevated. Plasma cells in the bone marrow accounted for 5% of the total, and no bone lesions or hypercalcemia were evident. The patient was therefore diagnosed as having pSS with MGUS (IgA-kappa) and was maintained on low-dose prednisolone therapy (2 mg daily). By 8 months before admission, the serum level of creatinine had been almost stable at 0.7\u20130.75 mg/dl [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 61.6\u201357.0 ml/min/1.732]. However, the level gradually increased thereafter, and was 1.2 mg/dl at the time of admission. In addition, the bilateral lung reticular shadows worsened during the few months before admission, and a dry cough had developed.\\nOn admission, the patient was 142 cm tall and weighed 47 kg, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. She was afebrile and showed no abnormal physical findings except for severe xerostomia. Mild bibasilar crackles in the lung were noted. Urinalysis showed pH 6.5, no hematuria, a scanty urinary sediment, and mild proteinuria (0.2 g/day). Glucosuria was not evident. The hemoglobin level was 9.6 g/dl, white blood cell count 4670/\u03bcl and platelet count 271,000/\u03bcl. The serum creatinine level was 1.20 mg/dl (normal range; 0.40\u20130.80), and blood urea nitrogen 31.6 mg/dl (8.0\u201322.0).",

He presented with the medical history of a well-controlled hypertension receiving an antihypertensive therapy of 5 mg of amlodipine per day. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 135/83 mmHg, 98% oxygen saturation on room air, and fast irregular pulses. The surface electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachycardic episode of AF with a heart rate of 148 b.p.m. that converted spontaneously to normo-frequent sinus rhythm during clinical presentation. Based on the first documented episode of AF, the patient\u2019s individual risk for thromboembolic events was assessed. Since no additional comorbidities were present at the time of admission, the patient\u2019s CHA2DS2-VASc score was 1 (only one point for hypertension) mirroring an annual stroke rate of 0.6\u20131.3%., According to treatment recommendations, initiation of OAC initiation should be considered and was subsequently evaluated via the patient\u2019s individual net-clinical benefit based on the recently published current opinion statement of the ESC Working Group on Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy and the ESC Council on Stroke.\\nThe assessment of patients\u2019 individual risk for major bleedings including modifiable risk factors is a key prerequisite for initiation of OAC. To elucidate the individual risk of bleeding events during OAC the HAS-BLED score is recommended as a highly validated tool to estimate the risk of bleeding during OAC. Notably, in patients with a HAS-BLED score of 2 (or greater) an OAC should not be initiated in intermediate thromboembolic risk patients based on an annual bleeding rates of 1.88\u20133.20% per year, since the risk for bleeding during OAC outweighs the thromboembolic risk.",

        "note": "First case\\nA 76-year-old female with a past medical history of paroxysmal non-valvular atrial fibrillation on coumadin (CHA2DS2-VASc score 6), stroke (that occurred seven years ago), hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease (stage IIIa) was evaluated as an in-patient for WATCHMAN device placement. She had developed recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds due to gastric ulcers and arteriovenous malformations in a diverticulum of the gastric fundus. It was decided that it was best for the patient to undergo a WATCHMAN procedure to decrease the risk of stroke. Her vitals were stable and a cardiopulmonary examination revealed an irregularly, irregular rhythm but she was otherwise mostly unremarkable.\\nHer laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dl, and normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Her renal panel was unremarkable except for a serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dl (normal range 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL). Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.02. The initial workup included a cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) scan which revealed no filling defect in the LAA. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed a maximal orifice diameter of 23 mm. She was felt to be a candidate for the WATCHMAN occlusion device with cardiac anatomy permitting its use.\\nInformed consent from the patient was obtained. Femoral vein access was gained and a 5-French angled pigtail catheter was inserted. Injection of contrast confirmed the satisfactory position of the pigtail catheter at the LAA orifice as noted in Figure . Upon further advancement of the sheath, a slight staining of the pericardium was noticed, which worsened over the next few minutes (Figure ). To prevent further progression to frank effusion upon recognition of the leak, it was decided to go ahead with the deployment of the device (Figure ). Satisfactory hemostasis was obtained. TEE showed satisfactory results with trace pericardial effusion and minimal peri-device leakage. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any hemodynamic instability. The effect of heparin was reversed using protamine sulfate. After achieving hemostasis in the groins, she was extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). She remained hemodynamically stable overnight. A limited 2D transthoracic echocardiogram performed on the next day revealed trace pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade and she was discharged home on aspirin and coumadin with close follow-up of her hemoglobin levels. TEE 45 days after device implantation revealed a well-seated WATCHMAN occluding device with a superior leak of less than 1 mm in width. No thrombus was noted on the anterior end of the device and no pericardial effusion was visible.\\nSecond case\\nAn 84-year-old female with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (CHA2DS2-VASc score 6), essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a transient ischemic attack was scheduled to undergo WATCHMAN device placement due to the occurrence of recurrent iliopsoas hematomas on anticoagulation. Her vitals and systemic examination were unremarkable.",

After the procedure, he was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 100 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Tests for prothrombotic mutations (Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene [G20210A]) and lupus anticoagulant were negative, and physiologic coagulation inhibitors were in the normal range. Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected. The patient refused prophylactic treatment with standard half-life (SHL) recombinant factor IX (rFIX) concentrate.\\nMore than 1 year after the DES implantation, he was admitted to the emergency department (ED) for melena and severe anemia. He had maintained dual antiplatelet therapy. Aspirin was discontinued, while clopidogrel was maintained. The patient was again offered prophylactic treatment with SHL rFIX, which he refused. He was subsequently lost to follow-up for several years.\\nFive years later, the patient presented to the ED with epistaxis, which had continued for several days. The patient was still taking clopidogrel. The epistaxis stopped after receiving SHL rFIX replacement therapy. The patient once again declined to begin rFIX prophylaxis when it was offered.\\nThe patient subsequently presented with hematuria and was diagnosed with lowgrade transitional cell carcinoma, for which he underwent curative resection. In 2017, he was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma and underwent resection of a growth on the pinna of the right ear.\\nIn February 2019, the patient (now aged 69 years; weight 67 kg; FIX 3.5%) attended a follow-up appointment. The patient\u2019s treatment timeline following this visit is summarized in .

Myeloproliferative disease was ruled out as no JAK2, CALR, or MPL gene mutations were detected. Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse, and an electrocardiogram and cardiologic assessment confirmed hypertensive ischemic heart disease complicated by arrhythmia due to NVAF, with uncertain time of onset. He was at high thrombotic risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3; ).",

The two sons had a history of \u201ceasy bleeding,\u201d and the daughter did not have such characteristics.\\nAt the age of 12 years, the two sons were diagnosed with hemophilia A; the results of the tests taken in 1978 are shown in . A chromosome analysis showed the normal 46XX karyotype. Both the patients' parents had died but there was no clinical history that the father had suffered from \u201cbleeding problems\u201d. No mutational analysis was carried out to confirm the diagnosis of hemophilia A.\\nFrom the time of the diagnosis, she had been treated with cryoprecipiate and later Factor VIII concentrates as necessary for dental extractions and a cholecystectomy.

There was no reported history of night sweats. The patient experienced a 5-month duration of unintentional weight loss of approximately 20 pounds. The patient is a medical doctor; however, there was no exposure to patients with tuberculosis. The family history was significant for first-degree relatives with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and cholangiocarcinoma.\\nThe patient was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute, tachypneic at 24 breaths per minute, saturating 92% on high flow nasal cannula. There was decreased air entry at the lower base of the left lung. A chest radiograph revealed complete opacification of the left lung zone (\u201cwhite-out\u201d) and a mediastinal mass. A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated marked sinus tachycardia with secondary ST-T changes suggestive of \u201cdemand-ischemia.\u201d An arterial blood gas sample was consistent with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The initial tentative diagnosis was suspected type 1 respiratory failure, likely multifactorial from the large pleural effusion in addition to suspected pulmonary embolism. A subsequent computed tomography \u201cpulmonary embolism protocol\u201d scan confirmed an anterior mediastinal mass (6.9 cm \u00d7 3.2 cm \u00d7 2.6 cm) with an associated large-sized left pleural effusion with perihilar lymphadenopathy and metastatic nodules. It also revealed a large right atrial thrombus (3.8 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm \u00d7 3.2 cm) without overt pulmonary emboli (see and ).\\nShe was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit, where she was stabilized and initiated upon therapeutic enoxaparin, low-dose aspirin, statin, ivabradine, and beta-blockade based on her high-risk Khorana score of 3. Her routine blood investigations were reflective of dehydration (see ). She also had 350 mL of serosanguinous fluid aspirated from her left lung via thoracentesis. Blood, urine, and pleural fluid cultures returned without bacterial growth. During her ensuing 2-week hospitalization, histopathology revealed features suggestive of thymic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant therapy comprising cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide (ADOC) was commenced. Surgical resection of the mass was performed where it was discovered that the tumor had metastasized to the left lung.

        "note": "A 92-year-old woman was accompanied to the Emergency Department in a coma status (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 7) with feces loss and fever (39.5\u00b0C). Blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 25 breaths/minute, and arterial blood oxygen saturation was 92% while breathing on room air. Furthermore, the physical examination revealed a systolic mitralic murmur and an inflamed area on perimalleolar skin on the right leg (). The personal medical history included hypertension, mild cognitive impairment related to vascular encephalopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and bleeding complications after falls during anticoagulant therapy. The patient did not take any immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drug at home. At admission, the electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmed atrial fibrillation with normal heart rate. Laboratory blood tests demonstrated a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13,160/mm3, haemoglobin of 159 g/L, lactic acid of 2.5 mmol/L, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin I of 0.238 \u03bcg/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 6.2 mg/L, and lactic dehydrogenase of 252 U/L. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan with angiographic sequences demonstrated the complete occlusion of the right intracranial vertebral artery, diffused signs of leukoencephalopathy, and no haemorrhages (). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excluded a recent cerebral ischemia but confirmed the occlusion of the right intracranial vertebral artery (). Total body CT scan was not able to detect any macroscopic foci of infection or cancer. The Doppler ultrasound examination of leg arteries and veins as well as carotid arteries did not detect any thrombosis and/or stenosis. Blood cultures were performed and, while waiting for the isolation time, an empirical antimicrobial treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started together with supportive therapies. No significant clinical improvement was observed, and inflammatory biomarkers, such as procalcitonin (with a peak of 4.0 \u00b5g/L) and CRP (with a peak of 200 mg/L), increased. On the other hand, troponin I blood concentration rapidly reached the normal values.\\nA targeted antimicrobial therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam was immediately started, in association with gentamicin in order to obtain a synergistic antimicrobial activity in consideration of the possible diagnosis of endocarditis. After one day of such a therapy, the patient's consciousness restored and the fever stopped. On day four after the admission, three blood cultures resulted positive for Gram-negative coccobacilli. In the Microbiology Laboratory, blood samples were collected and inoculated in BD BACTEC\u2122 Plus Aerobic/F and Anaerobic/F culture vials and incubated in the automated system BD BACTEC. Positive aerobic specimens were seeded on blood and chocolate agar plates, giving round, grey, nonhaemolytic, nonmucoid pure colonies after 24 hours. Bacterial stain was identified as Pasteurella multocida with the automated biochemical testing Vitek 2 (BioMeri\u00e9ux Italia S.p.A., Grassina, Italy), which also performed antibiotic sensitivity, indicated in . Identification was confirmed with the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) VITEK MS (BioMeri\u00e9ux Italia S.p.A.). The transthoracic echocardiogram on day 10 did not show any endocarditic lesions, and the patient completely recovered. In the meanwhile, the patient could refer about the skin lesion due to her cat bite, occurring one week before her hospital admission. Since the cat was still living at the patient's home, a sample of its saliva was analyzed.\\nIn particular, a cat pharyngeal swab was performed and seeded on blood and chocolate agar plates and grew at 37\u00b0C in aerobic condition. After 24 hours, mixed bacterial colonies grew, from which an isolation on blood agar was performed to grow in anaerobic condition. The anaerobic growth gave the sole colonies the same look as the ones isolated from patient blood culture. Colonies from cat were identified as Pasteurella multocida through the same technologies, that is, the automated biochemical testing and the mass spectrometry. The antibiotic sensitivity of cat strain was analyzed with the Vitek system as well. The phenotype of sensitivity of the patient strain and cat strain was the same, and the related MIC values were similar (). In particular, cefotaxime MIC value of patient isolates was < 1 mg/L, while that of cat isolates was 1 mg/L. Such a quantitative diversity corresponds to the variability achievable with a strain alone ().\\nThe patient was discharged after 15 days of antimicrobial therapy (ampicillin/sulbactam and gentamicin). Additional blood cultures during antibiotic treatment were negative, and procalcitonin and CRP levels were reduced to 0.09 \u00b5g/L and 33.6 mg/L, respectively. Additional 15-day treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was recommended at home. During hospitalization, the patient underwent anticoagulation therapy for elevated ischemic stroke risk (CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc Score: 7 points) since the beginning of deambulation.",

Her past medical history included arterial hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy with normal left ventricular function, dyslipidemia, and overweight (body mass index of 29 kg/m2). Around the age of 65, she had been occasionally seen in the hospital\u2019s outpatient department because of palpitations, when intermittent non-valvular AF had been diagnosed and successfully treated with amiodarone for a total of 3 years. Amiodarone was then suspended by her cardiologist. Long-term pharmacological treatment included daily aspirin 100 mg, nebivolone 5 mg, losartan 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg.\\nOne month prior to admission, on October 8, 2015, she had been hospitalized for a first time because of chest pain in the presence of tachyarrhythmia. It was interpreted as a recurrence of non-valvular AF in congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions and a moderately elevated N-terminal pro brain-type natriuretic peptide value of 4136 pg/mL. Acute coronary syndrome had been successfully ruled out, however, repeatedly elevated fasting blood glucose levels and an elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c level established the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, for which dietary treatment was initiated. Tachycardia was successfully controlled by the reimplementation of amiodarone, which the patient had already well tolerated in the past; diuretic therapy was started with furosemide. Liver function parameters had been normal but creatinine levels were increased to 1.51 mg/dL corresponding to a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimate of 32 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 according to the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula. Because of AF, stroke and bleeding risks were scored with the results for CHA2DS2-VASc of 6.",

No further periods of AF were detected on a 24-hour ECG Holter monitorization and further daily ECG studies.\\nDuring hospitalization, the patient developed sudden left ear neurosensorial deafness, followed several hours later by left hemiataxia, despite proper anticoagulation; emergency CT scan demonstrated multiple hypodense areas in the left cerebellar hemisphere; apixaban was switched to intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy.\\nAn MRI performed the next day revealed the aforementioned cerebellar infarctions along with subacute infarction of the left middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), extending into the left lateral pons (Figure ). CT angiography (CTA) revealed a left vertebral artery (VA) emerging directly from the aortic arch, with an atherosclerotic plaque near its origin (not shown). Aspirin was added to the previous treatment. After several days without neurological events, the patient was switched from unfractionated heparin to dabigatran, with maintenance of aspirin.\\nThe presence of patent foramen ovale was investigated by means of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography at the level of the middle cerebral arteries and injection of contrast solution; however, no high-intensity transient signals were recorded; furthermore, the recording was continued for thirty minutes, but no spontaneous micro-embolic signals were detected.\\nDuring the end of the hospital stay, the patient abruptly developed left peripheral facial palsy, considered to be a result of infarction extension.\\nTEE was performed, being mandated by inconclusive previous investigations and unsuccessful recurrence control. A complex, ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque with a mobile component, with a measured, maximum thickness of 9 mm was identified (Figure , arrow). Furthermore, no thrombus or dense spontaneous echo contrast was identified at the level of the left atrial appendage. Clopidogrel was thus finally added to treatment.\\nExcept for deafness, the patient recovered completely and was discharged on dabigatran, dual antiplatelet therapy (for one month, then aspirin alone), and maximum dose statin (40 mg rosuvastatin), with no ischemic recurrence since, to our knowledge.",

Upon admission, the patient had a computed tomography (CT) score of 3/20 based on Chung and colleagues' criteria []. The patient had a significant medical history that included chronic iron deficiency anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, persistent atrial fibrillation, and chronic cerebral vasculopathy. She was receiving regular therapy with amiodarone, oral ferrous sulfate, ramipril, and aclidinium bromide. Prior to admission, she had received 2 units of packed red blood cells for severe anemia in the emergency department at the other hospital (Hb was 7.2 g/dl).\\nUpon admission, laboratory studies revealed a hematocrit of 32,7% (38 - 46%), microcytic anemia with hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (11.7 - 13.8 g/dL), a mean corpuscular volume of 74 fl (80-100fl). Ferritinemia was in the average range of 103 ng/mL (20-120 ng/dL) while transferrin saturation was only 10%. Levels of Hb and transferrin saturation during hospital recovery are shown in Figure .\\nOn day 1, inflammatory marker levels of IL-6 (<7) and C-reactive protein (0.5-1 mg/dL) were 20.2 pg/ml and 0.21 mg/dL, respectively. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) was negative, while the colonoscopy showed the presence of hemorrhoids and the search for occult blood was positive. Given the patient\u2019s history of chronic anemia and low transferrin saturation, she was given IV ferric carboxymaltose 1000 mg on day 4. On day 6, her Hb was 8.6 mg/dl, which further decreased to 8.3 mg/dl on day 9, while transferrin saturation improved to 22%. On day 13, transferrin saturation had increased to 31% with a Hb of 8.2 g/dl, and the patient received 500 mg IV ferric carboxymaltose. On day 15, her Hb decreased to 7.7 g/dl, which was followed by a sharp increase to 9.4 g/dl on day 16, reaching 9.8 g/dl on day 22 of admission with a transferrin saturation of 26%. On day 25, given the stable condition of the patient, the negative inflammatory markers (IL-6 and C.reactive protein) and a negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, she was discharged from her previous therapeutic regimen with the indication to evaluate anticoagulant therapy with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) after appropriate controls of hemoglobin in consideration of a CHADS2-VASc score of 6.",

        "note": "An 87 year old man with longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation and elevated stroke risk (CHADSVASC score = 3) was felt not to be candidate for chronic oral anticoagulation due to repeated falls associated with orthopedic injury. He was referred to our Electrophysiology Laboratory for percutaneous suture ligation of the left atrial appendage.\\nA pre-operative CT angiogram was performed to determine the patient's left atrial appendage anatomy. This showed a single lobed appendage 3.3cm in length with a trabeculated distal portion and was deemed suitable for the exclusion procedure. Under general anesthesia, intra-operative 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated no left atrial thrombus. A Tuohy needle was used to enter the pericardial space via a subxiphoid approach under fluoroscopic guidance. Entry into the pericardial space was anterior-lateral, using contrast and a lateral fluoroscopic view. The access site was sequentially dilated and a 13Fr sheath was placed into the pericardial space. Next, trans-septal puncture was performed using an 8.5 Fr SL-1 sheath and an Extra Sharp Brokenbrough needle, via the right femoral vein. A Heparin drip was initiated to maintain adequate activated clotting time (250-300 sec).\\nA left atrial angiogram with an occlusive balloon (SentreHeart Endocath) confirmed the LAA size, shape and orientation, consistent with CTA findings. A magnet-tipped guidewire (Sentreheart FindrWIRZ) wire was advanced into the distal portion of left atrial appendage. A second magnet-tipped guidewire was advanced into the subxiphoid space and coupled magnetically to the LAA wire, in the end-to-end configuration. The Lariat suture loop was then advanced into the pericardial space over the magnet guidewire. The suture loop could not be advanced to the base of the appendage due to separation of the guidewire magnets. After manipulation of the suture loop the magnets were often noted to be in the end-to-side configuration, preventing successful positioning of the suture loop.\\nDuring manipulation of the magnet-tipped guidewires, the patient became hypotensive to a systolic pressure of 55 mmHg and a new pericardial effusion was noticed on TEE (). Approximately 200cc of blood was drained from the side arm of the epicardial sheath with some initial improvement in hemodynamics. The effusion reaccumulated and the blood pressure dropped. A pigtail catheter was emergently placed in the pericardial space. A total of 800cc was drained and autotransfused back to the patient. The patient's hemodynamic condition stabilized and the decision was made to continue the case. Hemostasis of the LAA would likely be achieved with successful application of the closure device.\\nWith the pigtail catheter in place, a second subxiphoid epicardial access was obtained, directed more laterally from the first. The epicardial needle was directed towards the magnet tipped wire already in the LAA. The new orientation of the epicardial sheath was felt to improve access to the left atrial appendage.\\nThe Lariat was advanced into the subxiphoid space through a second 13Fr sheath and easily tracked over the guidewire around the base of left atrial appendage. Appropriate position of the suture was confirmed with balloon inflation, atrial angiography, and color Doppler and 3D TEE ().\\nThe suture loop was successfully deployed and there was no further accumulation of the effusion. Intra-op TEE showed no residual flow in the appendage. The pigtail catheter was left in place. Protamine was administered to partially reverse anticoagulation.\\nFollow-up transthoracic echocardiography 12 hours later showed no pericardial effusion and the pigtail catheter was removed. The patient was later discharged home.",

        "note": "A 68-year-old man was examined in the outpatient department of our hospital by transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) because the attending cardiologist suspected mitral valve endocarditis. The patient\u2019s medical history revealed permanent AF, drug-, and hepatitis E-induced liver cirrhosis (CHILD Score B) being on vitamin-K-antagonist (VKA), a biological aortic valve replacement in 2011 and long-standing hypertension. Due to a history of cirrhosis-associated major gastric bleeding complications in February 2014, while being on VKA and rheumatoid arthritis with long-term glucocorticoid therapy, an LAA closure procedure was planned 3 months later in our hospital. At that time, the patient had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 points (age 65\u201374 years +1 and hypertension +1) and a HAS-BLED score of 5 points (age, hypertension, abnormal liver function, labile International Normalized Ratio (INR), and prior major bleeding; each +1). Despite antihypertensive combination therapy, including a diuretic, the patient\u2019s blood pressure remained increased. Therefore, in combination with the glucocorticoid therapy, the bleeding risk (estimated risk 9\u201312%) was substantially higher than the risk for ischaemic stroke (estimated at 2.2%). At the time, guidelines did not recommend direct oral anticoagulants as an alternative to VKA use as there was insufficient data. As a result, a percutaneous LAA closure was performed in May 2014 and a 33-mm WATCHMAN device was implanted in the LAA of a chicken wing type and a left atrial (LA) size of 22 cm2. The WATCHMAN device size was chosen based on a maximum LAA ostium size of 30 mm, for which a 33-mm WATCHMAN device is recommended. The manufacturer\u2019s standard guidelines and recommendations were followed and the procedure was performed without any adverse events. Post-interventional TOE assessment showed an appropriate closure of the LAA. The patient was discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) comprising aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 3 months, to which he was compliant.\\nIn July 2015, the patient was diagnosed with an ischaemic stroke due to the occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and carotid endarterectomy performed. A TOE performed at the time showed no intracardiac thrombus. Systemic lysis was performed, which resulted in intracranial bleeding. As a result, the CHA2DS2-VASc score increased to 4 points (age 65\u201374 years +1, hypertension +1, and stroke +2; estimated risk 4%) and the HAS-BLED score increased to 6 points [age, hypertension, abnormal liver function, labile INR, prior major bleeding, and (NEW) stroke; each +1 point; estimated risk higher than 9.1%], respectively. After conservative treatment, the patient was discharged to outpatient care with only slight neurological deficits (insecure gait) and his daily life was not impaired. The patient again received DAPT for 3 months, but no oral anticoagulation.\\nIn April 2016, the patient was invited by the outpatient cardiologist for a routine transthoracic echocardiographic assessment, which included the evaluation of the prosthetic aortic valve function. Examination revealed a mobile mass towards the mitral valve, which was suspected to be potentially endocarditis-related. The size of the left atrium was only slightly larger than in 2014 (25 cm2). A TOE, which was performed shortly after hospital admission, confirmed this mobile mass (\u223c40 mm \u00d7 15 mm in size) arising from a cleft of the LAA and located between the pulmonary vein ridge and the LAA device itself (). The structure periodically prolapsed through the mitral valve leaflets and was of dense texture with only minor mobility. Anticoagulation with partial thrombopplastin time (PTT)-controlled heparin (PTT 50\u201380 s) was initiated. The patient remained completely asymptomatic, without showing any clinical evidence of peripheral embolism or neurological event.

He was selected for the WATCHMAN device. The initial procedure was aborted after significant resistance to device advancement was encountered in the right femoral vein. Bilateral lower extremity venography demonstrated totally occluded femoral and iliac veins bilaterally (. Given no transvenous access to the inferior vena cava, the decision was made to implant the device via a transhepatic approach.\\nUnder general anaesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance, percutaneous transhepatic access to the right hepatic vein was achieved by an interventional radiologist under sterile condition (. First, a skin incision was made below the costal margin at the mid-axillary line. The trajectory of the needle was guided by the visualization of the hepatic vein. The needle was advanced with intermittent gentle aspiration until blood is obtained, and then the contrast was injected to visualize entry into the hepatic vein. Once the needle entered the hepatic vein, a 0.035-inch wire was advanced via the hepatic vein into the superior vena cava. A Cook Medical (Bloomington, IN, USA) 16 Fr Check-Flo Performer introducer was passed over the wire and situated at the inferior vena cava. A St. Jude Medical (St. Paul, MN, USA) SL1 long 8.5 Fr introducer (curve type SL1\u2122, sheath usable length 63 cm and dilator usable length 67 cm) was passed over the wire to the superior vena cava.

At the mid-level of the intact septum, a posterior puncture was performed and the SL1 was advanced into the left atrium. The patient was anticoagulated with heparin with an activated clotting time (ACT) goal of 200 s given transhepatic access. An Amplatz Super Stiff (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) 0.035-inch wire was advanced to the left superior pulmonary vein. The SL1 was exchanged for a Boston Scientific double curve WATCHMAN 14 Fr delivery sheath. A 6 Fr pigtail catheter was utilized to direct this sheath into the LAA. A 27-mm WATCHMAN device was chosen after the angiography of the LAA. Under apnoeic conditions, the device was deployed (Video 1) with angiography and TOE confirming the seal of the appendage. The 16-Fr delivery sheath was then utilized to perform final venograms. After device delivery, the vascular sheath was injected with contrast for hepatic venography. A 6-Fr Terumo destination sheath was then advanced into the lumen of the 16-Fr sheath and we sequentially deployed two 10-mm Amplatzer occluding plugs (AGA Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) in the transhepatic tract. The plugs were sequentially forming a characteristic dog bone appearance (Video 2). Complete hemostasis was achieved. Final TOE demonstrated no significant pericardial effusion. Due to the manipulation of the vasculature in that area, he was monitored for 48 h to rule out any signs and symptoms of bleeding. After his vital signs, physical exam and labs remained stable for 48 h, oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and antiplatelet therapy (with aspirin) was started. He had an uneventful hospitalization and was discharged home after 3 days. No adverse events were reported at follow-up. He was instructed to continue rivaroxaban and aspirin for 6 weeks, switch to aspirin and clopidogrel until 6 months, and after that aspirin alone.",

His vital signs indicated systolic blood pressures of 144 mm Hg, heart rate of 123 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths/minute with an oxygen saturation of 92% on supplemental oxygen. His physical examination revealed an elevated jugular venous pulse of 10 cm of H2O, 4/6 holosystolic murmur with a prominent P2 auscultated at the left lower sternal border, bilateral basal crackles, and pitting edema to the tibial tuberosities.\\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgM antibody serologies (Abbott Laboratories) on arrival to the emergency department were negative. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and right axis deviation. A portable chest radiograph displayed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema with Kerley B lines and bilateral small pleural effusions. Routine investigations were performed (). A bedside 2-dimensional TTE (2D-TTE) demonstrated mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 40% to 45%, with severe right ventricular dilation and dysfunction with evidence of both pressure and volume overload. There was also moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension with mean right ventricular systolic pressures of 56 mm Hg (). The RV appeared to have marked trabeculations with deep sinusoidal recesses and crypts, whereas the LV displayed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy ().\\nThe patient was subsequently admitted to the cardiac care unit and underwent a CT-PE protocol based on his moderate Wellens\u2019 score of 4.5, electrocardiographic changes, and markedly elevated D-dimer with a contrast-induced nephropathy protocol for his estimated glomerular filtration rate of 53 mL/min/1.73 m2.

        "note": "A 69-year-old woman with repaired TOF suffering from recurrent haemoptysis was referred to our institution for further investigations. She underwent palliation in 1962 (age 12) with a classic right-sided BTT shunt and TOF repair in 1967 (age 17) with closure of the VSD, relief of the RV outflow tract obstruction, and closure of the BTT shunt. Over the course of the years, she developed atrial fibrillation for which she was started on oral anticoagulation. In 1993, she had a first episode of massive haemoptysis which was treated conservatively. In 2002, computed tomography (CT) indicated a stellate nodule in the right upper lung lobe. Over the next years the lesion remained stable on axial follow-up imaging. In 2019, after new episodes of haemoptysis, this time with progressively worsening dyspnoea, a positron emission tomography\u2013CT was performed showing isotope accumulation in the lesion of the right upper lung lobe (). She underwent a bronchoscopy that showed mucosal swelling in the right upper lobe. Cytology indicated acute inflammation without evidence of malignancy.\\nOn physical examination, the right-sided radial pulse was absent and blood pressure (BP) not measurable. Blood pressure and heart rate taken on the left arm were 112/45 mmHg and 78 b.p.m., respectively. Respiratory rate was 22 per minute. The second heart sound was pronounced with a grade 3/6 systolic and 2/4 diastolic murmur at the second intercostal space on the left. C-reactive protein was normal (2.9 mg/L) and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide slightly elevated (733 ng/L). The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with inferolateral ST depression and Q-waves in V1\u2013V2\u2013aVR (). Transthoracic echocardiography indicated a moderately dilated RV with normal systolic function, a peak/mean gradient of 53/32 mmHg across the pulmonary valve with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation ().\\nA diagnostic cardiac catheterization was performed but no arteriovenous connections were seen and the BTT shunt was not patent. Right atrial pressure was 14 mmHg, RV systolic pressure 56 mmHg, systolic pulmonary artery pressure 33 mmHg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure 21 mmHg. The RV was dilated with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation. A bronchoscopy with EndoBronchial UltraSound (EBUS) in order to perform EBUS guided biopsy was performed. A rope-like structure was seen through the bronchoscope, but we were unable to take a biopsy ().\\nAfter multidisciplinary discussion, the findings appeared to be most consistent with chronic inflammation due to a foreign body with secondary chronic inflammation, rather than vasculitis or a granulomatous infection, and the patient underwent a thoracotomy with lobectomy of the superior lobe of the right lung. The foreign body was removed without any resistance nor bleeding. Pathology indicated diffuse necrotizing granulomatous inflammation around the rope-like structure ( and ) which appeared to be the old suture around the BTT shunt that had caused a chronic inflammatory reaction invading the right upper bronchus and causing haemoptysis. The patient remained stable after the procedure. She left the hospital after a couple of days. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. After 3 months, she underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement. After the surgical intervention, given a CHA2DS2 VASc score of 6/9, the fact that the most likely source of haemoptysis was removed, she was started on edoxaban 60 mg once daily.",

        "note": "A 78-year-old male with past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation (AF) with CHA2DS2VASC score of 2, and rheumatoid arthritis well controlled on etanercept therapy since 1997, was referred to an anticoagulation clinic pharmacist for management of apixaban 3 months ago. The patient\u2019s allergy history was pertinent for developing rash to fluoroquinolones and Stevens Johnson Syndrome to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient presented to the emergency department at Salem Veterans Affair Medical Center (SVAMC) with a chief complaint of rash on both his upper extremity (UE), primarily forearms, and torso that started about 1 month previously. The patient denies any changes in clothing, detergents, or contact with chemicals. No oral or genital lesions were found. No other new medications were added recently, and no other medication dosage changes were noted. Physical examination revealed the presence of erythematous excoriated patches on the upper chest area, and violaceous patches with lacy scales on the left UE, while right UE exam showed more atrophic patches with little scales. At this time, the patient was diagnosed to most likely have drug-induced lichen planus with the possibility of apixaban being the culprit agent, and was offered biopsy for further evaluation. The patient was prescribed steroid ointment (clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment) to see if this helped alleviate his symptoms, and biopsy was scheduled in 1 month. The patient was instructed to discontinue steroid ointment 1 week prior to the biopsy. Physical examination at a follow up visit revealed that steroid ointment had cleared some of the rash, but did not completely resolve, and the patient reported no itching. The patient had new violaceous macules on the left side of the neck, while keratotic lesions had appeared on the right clavicular area. Several violaceous macules with lacy scales were noted on both UE. At this visit, two biopsies were obtained: shave biopsy of the right clavicular area and right forearm, and 3.5 mm punch biopsy from the left upper arm. Pathology report () revealed compact orthokeratosis, a thin atrophic epidermis with leukocytosis, and chronic interface dermatitis with superficial lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate with melanophages that extended focally to the mid-dermis level. Vacuolar alterations and several Civatte bodies in the epidermis and along the dermoepidermal interface was consistent with lichenoid eruption; however, atrophic lichen planus cannot be ruled out. Using further clinical correlation with patient-specific factors, it was determined that lichenoid drug eruption was the most probable diagnosis. The patient was advised to resume steroid ointment but avoid the biopsy sites, and to return in 6 weeks. The patient reported some relief with continual use of steroid ointment at this follow up. He still had rash on chest and forearms, with some hypopigmented patches where he had the inflammation before. However, the patient denied itching. He was advised to continue topical steroids at this time for an additional 2 weeks. A month after this encounter, the patient presented with resolution of previously developed rash; however, a new erythematous irregular and rough lesion had appeared on the right forearm. Per patient, the rash that had resolved with steroid use seemed to be coming back since he stopped using it 2 weeks ago. Around the same time, the patient also presented to the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) department for a left side cervical adenopathy, which was noted as a necrotic left submandibular gland mass with left level II and III adenopathy. He underwent submandibular gland excision, for which he had to stop apixaban for 5 days before the procedure, and reported almost complete resolution of rash during this time. The rash reappeared after apixaban was resumed post-surgery; the patient self-discontinued it after 2 weeks and called the primary care physician to inform of this. Several attempts were made to contact the patient to switch to another DOAC; however, the anticoagulation clinic pharmacist was unable to reach him. Almost 4 weeks after submandibular excision surgery, the patient was seen in the anticoagulation clinic, where he was then switched to rivaroxaban. At this visit, the patient reported complete resolution of the rash developed secondary to apixaban exposure post-surgery. At the subsequent anticoagulation clinic follow up at ~2 months, the patient reports continued tolerance to rivaroxaban and denies any rash or itching symptoms.

Her physical examination was unremarkable, except for high blood pressure (188/104 mmHg) and excess weight (body mass index = 28 kg/m2); a blood test showed a high D-dimer concentration (2170 \u03bcg/l). A computed tomography (CT) scan performed to exclude pulmonary embolism was inconclusive. However, fat infiltration around the left jugular-carotid led to a further investigation using neck ultrasound. This showed a thrombosis emerging from the base of the left subclavian vein and extending 11 centimeters into the IJV, sparing the cerebral vessels.\\nThe patient described spontaneous hair loss and a 10 kg gain in weight over the previous year. She was taking levothyroxine but took no other medication or hormonal substitutes. There was no history of smoking, recent surgery, trauma, infectious disease, intravenous medical or recreational drug use, or past catheter insertion.\\nA chest CT scan and a colonoscopy revealed no cancer. A recent gynecological check-up consisting of a physical examination, a mammography, and a Pap smear found no pathology. A thyroid-stimulating hormone test and urinary cortisol were normal. Because of the patient\u2019s young age and no obvious risk factor for thromboembolic disease, we completed the investigations with a thrombophilia workup. Antinuclear antibodies were positive at 1:320, but without other criteria suggesting overt lupus []. Otherwise, antinucleoprotein antibodies (SSA, SSB, RNP, Sm, Scl70, Jo1), antinucleosome antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-B2-glycoprotein antibodies were negative. We did not test for lupus anticoagulant due to the patient\u2019s anticoagulation treatment and the risk of a false-positive []. Antithrombin, protein C, and protein S activity were within the normal ranges and were tested before the introduction of anticoagulant treatment. Only a heterozygous factor V Leiden gene (R506Q) was found positive. We concluded on the diagnosis of an unprovoked IJV thrombosis.\\nAfter 5 days of intravenous unfractionated heparin, symptoms rapidly regressed, allowing a switch to an oral anticoagulant (acenocoumarol). The patient was discharged home 1 week after admission. After 3 months, the decision to continue anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was taken according to European Society of Cardiology guidelines [] for patients over 50 years old with unprovoked thrombosis and a low risk of major bleeding.",

        "note": "The patient (AS) is a 79-year-old Caucasian man who was born and raised in London, United Kingdom (UK). As a lifelong conditioned athlete, his resting heart rate had been 40 to 50 beats per minute (bpm) in normal sinus rhythm until 1973. After competing in and winning a tennis tournament, he presented to his general practitioner with palpitations but had no shortness of breath, weakness, tiredness, reduced ability to be physically active, lightheadedness or dizziness. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed AF with a ventricular rate (VR) of 120. He was digitalized and maintained on 0.125 milligrams (mg) digoxin daily. He refused further medical follow-up and declined to take warfarin due to his perception of an increased risk of bleeding, but chose 325 mg aspirin daily. In 1999, at age 59 he won the UK national amateur tennis championship in the 55 and over division. In 2002, he moved to Boca Raton, Florida, US but returned to the UK for hip replacements in 2007 and 2017. He lives at home with his wife and remains physically active walking daily as well as playing tennis and pickleball three to five times per week. A few months ago, he went for a routine physical examination which revealed an alert, lean and fit man looking younger than his stated age with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air in no respiratory distress. He had no jugular venous distention. His pulse was irregularly irregular, and ECG showed AF with a VR of 72 (Figure ).\\nHis blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg. Cardiac exam revealed no murmurs and he had no lower extremity edema.\\nHis Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes mellitus, Stroke-Vascular Disease, Age, Sex Category (CHADS-VASC) score was three, which predicted an annual risk of stroke of 3.2% per year [,].",

        "note": "A 75-year-old man with persistent AF, a CHA2DS2 VASc score of 4 and recurrent gastrointestinal bleedings was referred to a tertiary clinic for a LAAC. His medical history consisted of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and a two-thirds gastric resection performed in the 1980s. The intervention was successfully performed with an ABBOTT\u00ae Amulet 18 mm device being implanted (). After the implantation, he received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and Clopidogrel for 6 months. Approximately 5 months post-intervention, the patient expressed acute dyspnoea and called the emergency medical services (EMS).\\nOn arrival of the EMS, the patient was conscious, severely distressed and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 90/min. Peripheral oxygen saturation of 85% measured percutaneously was noted. After the administration of bronchodilator medication for a presumed COPD exacerbation, the patient\u2019s clinical condition deteriorated with a resultant cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions, endotracheal intubation, and the administration of 3 mg Adrenaline. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred approximately 10 min later at which point he was transferred to a local hospital. During the transport, the cardiocirculatory parameters were relatively stable with a systolic pressure around 100 mmHg. The capnometry after return of spontaneous circulation measured a pCO2 of 60 mmHg. Upon arrival at the hospital, the physical examination showed jugular vein distension but no peripheral oedema.\\nEchocardiography performed in the emergency department revealed a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoidal route, 800 mL of blood were initially evacuated. The differential diagnosis included primary respiratory failure or a sudden cardiac death with secondary pericardial effusion induced by cardiac compressions under double antiplatelet therapy, a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a myocardial rupture, or a primary laceration of a cardiac structure by the LAA occluder. A ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta was excluded by ultrasound. Electrocardiogram examination did not demonstrate any ST-segment elevation or low voltage. Blood gas analysis documented a stable respiratory situation with a pO2 of 230 mmHg and a pCO2 of 55 mmHg, the pH was 7, 3 and Lactate elevated with 10 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). The haemoglobin was measured at 9 g/dL (12\u201316 g/dL). The chest X-ray demonstrated the proper placement of the endotracheal and pericardial tube and ruled out a pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema.\\nIn the hours following pericardiocentesis, approximately 2 L of blood were evacuated. Conventional methods of coagulopathy management including application of tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen did not stop the bleeding. To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.\\nIn preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium. The LAA was closed by endocardial sutures and two pledget sutures were used to seal the epicardial lesion at the LAA basis which stopped the bleeding. Fortunately, after prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit and weaning ward the patient was discharged and alive 4 months after the event without neurological deficit and on ASA monotherapy. Transthoracic echocardiogram in the weaning ward ruled out a persistent pericardial effusion.",

Physical examination carried out revealed unconsciousness, loss of cooperation and orientation, cold and sweaty body, arterial blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 124 pulse/minute and respiratory rate of 24/minute. The rest of the physical examination was normal. The measured serum glucose (PG) was 30 mg/dl. A bolus of 50% dextrose was administered immediately. The neurological, cardiac and pulmonary examinations and the laboratory tests were normal. The biochemical analysis of the patient's serum revealed normal sodium level. The patient's body temperature was normal and there was no evidence of infection. During the follow-up there was no hypotensive attack. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward with a diagnosis of hypoglycemia. The PG was measured hourly. Infusion of 20% dextrose was continued. At the end of first hour, the patient was reevaluated. His consciousness was clear and physical examination was normal. The patient's PG at the 1st hour was 146 mg/dl and he was clinically stable. 10% dextrose was administered slowly as an infusion.

In addition, gait disturbance, dizziness and vertigo with tendency to fall to the right side, and an intractable pain in both legs occurred 1 day prior to hospitalization. Lastly, he reported a worsening polyuria, polydipsia, and peripheral edema. On admission, the level of consciousness appeared to be normal. Medication included lisinopril (2.5 mg/d), carvedilol (6.25 mg/d), pantoprazole (40 mg/d), pregabaline (75 mg/d), xifaxan (500 mg/d), sodiumhydrogencarbonate (1 g/d) and lactulose solution. Comorbidities included carpal-tunnel syndrome and gonarthrosis.\\nSix days prior to hospitalization, the patient reported the ingestion of a whole fruit cake (estimated glucose amount: 154 g) and, concurrently, the consumption of 10 soft drinks (2 Liters, estimated sugar content: 212 g according to the ingredients\u2019 list). During this binge-eating attack, the estimated grand total of ingested sugar was 366 g. According to the family physician, the graving for sweets occurred since the patient refrained from alcohol 8 months ago. A serum glucose measurement obtained by the family practitioner 5 days prior to hospitalisation was 38.5 mmol/l (694 mg/dl). On admission, venous-blood glucose was 29.1 mmol/l (523.8 mg/dl), glycated hemoglobin was 168.0 mmol/mol or 17.6% (result as percentage was calculated using the following formula: HbA1C [%] = HbA1C [mmol/mol] * 0,0915 + 2,15) demonstrating a poor glycemic control over the last 6 weeks. Four months prior to admission, glycated hemoglobin still was 62.8 mmol/mol or 7.9%.\\nOn admission, a mild hyponatremia of 133 mmol/l was found. Of note, no hyponatremia had been detected prior to hospitalization. In addition, sodium-chloride supplementation or any other voluntary salt intake were not reported. The concomitant liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B; first diagnosis: 28 months earlier) due to alcoholism over 18 years was treated by a transjugular porto-systemic shunt 7 months prior to the index hospitalization. In addition, 8 months prior to index hospitalisation, a subcutaneous insulin regimen (fixed-dose prandial lispro insulin. Cumulative dose: 34 units per day) was initiated for documented hyperglycemic episodes during a hospital stay for decompensated liver cirrhosis. However, at that time, the patient discontinued the insulin therapy after discharge. Outpatient capillary-blood glucose tests, except shortly prior to index hospitalisation, were not performed. A reevaluation of the patient\u2019s capacity to apply insulin therapy at home was not performed neither.\\nLaboratory exams during index hospitalisation revealed elevated serum ammonia levels (127.1 \u03bcmol/l on admission), rendering a hepatic encephalopathy very likely. In-hospital blood tests for ethanol were negative. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ranged between 46 and 56 ml/min/1.73m2 during the hospital stay, proteinuria was ruled out, thus confirming the preexisting chronic kidney disease stage G3aA1 (kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) classification []). An infection or sepsis were ruled out on admission. After initiation of insulin therapy, capillary-blood glucose normalized (Fig. ), and serum sodium rose to 144 mmol/l during the hospital stay. In retrospect, the mild hyponatremia on admission was classified as pseudohyponatremia due to hyperglycemia.\\nThe patient was shown to have a state of insulin resistance.",

According to his medical history, at the age of two years, he received a diagnosis of Wohlfart\u2013Kugelberg\u2013Welander syndrome (SMA type III); at the age of 17 years, he underwent an arthrodesis surgical intervention for vertebral collapse and severe scoliosis; at the age of 28 years, he was given a diagnosis of a severe sleep apnoea syndrome, and since then, he has been under bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP); these ongoing conditions are known to be a consequence of SMA and tend to worsen in the presence of obesity.\\nIndeed, over the 15 years before coming to our attention, the patient's body weight had progressively increased by about 15 kg to just over 101 kg (his weight at the age of 20 was roughly 85 kg), which indicated the onset of obesity; this was likely due to a forced sedentary lifestyle (the patient was wheelchair-bound) and an alteration in his eating habits (i.e., eating in excess between meals). He reported having undergone several weight-loss attempts (>3) as an outpatient, with unsuccessful results.\\nThe patient, referred to us by his general practitioner, was assessed by means of the Comprehensive Appropriateness Scale for the Care of Obesity in Rehabilitation (CASCO-R) to determine the most appropriate healthcare setting for his weight-loss treatment []. The patient had a CASCO-R global score of >25, indicating the appropriateness of residential rehabilitative treatment for obesity, which he voluntarily agreed to. Hence, he was admitted to the Villa Garda Hospital Department of Eating and Weight Disorders on 2 December 2016. At admission, he had a body weight of 101.4 kg (BMI 32.0 kg/m2). According to the Italian version of the 17th edition of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview [], he had a global score of 0.74, which is <1 standard deviation (SD) above the community mean (i.e., under 1.74); he reported no binge-eating episodes or purging behaviours (i.e., self-induced vomiting and laxative or diuretic misuse) over the preceding three months, which indicated the absence of a binge-eating disorder or other types of eating disorder [].\\nFasting blood samples were obtained on the day of admission (Day 1), and laboratory tests () showed raised C-reactive protein (1.46 mg/dl; normal values: <0.1 mg/dl), fibrinogen (433 mg/dl; normal values: 150\u2013400 mg/dl), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (29 mm/h; normal values: 0\u201320 mm/h), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (121 mg/dl; normal values: <100 mg/dl), insulin (27.8 mcU/ml; normal values: 1.9\u201323.0 mcU/ml), and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (47 mg/dl; normal values: >60 mg/dl).",

        "note": "The proband is a 25 year old Caucasian female born from nonconsanguineous parents of Maltese ethnicity. She developed obesity in early childhood, with a body weight at the 97th centile at the age of 9 years. She was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at age 11 following her presentation with osmotic symptoms of hyperglycaemia. No diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis was present, and both glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet cell antibodies were negative. She was initially treated by diet and lifestyle changes, and eventually started on metformin during childhood.\\nThe proband became pregnant at age 21 years, and she delivered a healthy but macrosomic male infant by Caesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation weighing 5.18 kg. Her glycaemic control deteriorated significantly during pregnancy and was managed by combination treatment of isophane and soluble insulin. Significant weight gain also developed during pregnancy, with a BMI up to 37 kg/m2. Pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy was also present in the proband.\\nSince pregnancy the proband developed persistent and significant microalbuminuria (urine microalbumin > 400 mg/L), leading to macroalbuminuria (albumin-creatinine ratio > 3000 mg/g) and glomerular hyperfiltration (eGFR >170mls/min/1.73m2) with normal creatinine levels. Urinalysis and urine microscopy showed no significant findings. Ultra-sonographic examination of the abdomen revealed normal size and echotexture in both kidneys, without any signs of obstructive uropathy, and normal cortical thickness and preservation of cortico-medullary differentiation. No evidence of autoimmune nephropathy or glomerulonephritis was present, with normal ANA, ANCA, C3, C4, rheumatoid factor IgM, uric acid, C-reactive protein and serum immunoglobulin levels. The proband also developed deranged liver function tests, with moderately elevated gamma glutamyl transferase and alanine transaminase levels. A viral hepatitis screen was negative, and hepatomegaly with no focal lesions and changes of a fatty liver were also evident on abdominal ultrasound.\\nAs an adult, she is presently overweight (BMI 28 kg/m2) and glycaemic control is achieved by a combination of oral hypoglycaemic agents including metformin 1 g tds, gliclazide 80 mg tds and vildagliptin 50 mg daily. The proband however shows poor glycaemic control on combination oral treatment, with HbA1c values around 10%. Her fasting C-peptide concentration at the time of referral for genetic analysis was 1.4 ng/mL, indicating endogenous insulin production.",

She had not previously received any diagnosis of disease except for psychiatric conditions. Height, weight, and BMI of the patient were 158 cm, 63 kg, and 25.2, respectively. Physical examination was done, and other than the presence of palpable protruding mass, no clinical signs or specific symptoms (e.g., pain or numbness) have been found. Ultrasonography was the first imaging study performed (Fig. ), which revealed characteristics of lipoma. Computed tomography (CT) images and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained to evaluate the depth and distribution of mass. Diffuse non-encapsulated adipose tissues were found in subcutaneous layers of suboccipital and posterior neck. There was no mass surrounding the tracheal area (Figs. , ). Partial excision of the mass was planned because the patient wanted it removed for cosmetic reasons and physical discomfort. There were no apparent brain lesions in MRI and no specific findings in neurologic examinations. The preoperative evaluation included plain radiography of the thorax, electrocardiography, and blood analyses. Our patient had impaired fasting glucose levels and elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and uric acid levels.

When she was 3 years old, she visited our hospital because of hypoglycemia, liver enzyme elevation, and hepatomegaly. She was diagnosed as having GSD type Ia based on the loss of G6Pase activity in the liver (< 0.3 \u00b5mol/minute/g tissue).\\nIn the first stage of life (3 years to 6 years), she needed frequent feedings and a night time cornstarch regimen until 7 years of age. After 8 years of age, her hypoglycemia improved and her glucose levels could be maintained with cornstarch intake twice a day. However, she had several complications such as kidney stones and hepatic adenomas with hepatomegaly.\\nAt 20 years of age, her BMI increased (to 24.2) and she presented hyperglycemia after food intake (Fig. ). The blood glucose dynamics indicated type 2 diabetes mellitus as described in Fig. [Fasting glucose: 123 mg/dl, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 9.23]. Therefore, cornstarch feeding at night was stopped.\\nAt 40 years of age, she presented hyperglycemia (200\u2013260 mg/dl after feeding and dumping syndrome-like symptoms such as nausea, general fatigue, and dorsal pain). Moreover, the dumping syndrome-like symptoms worsened, resulting in poor quality of life. At first, she misunderstood that the complication was related to hypoglycemia and thus increased feeding, leading to an increase in body weight (maximum BMI was 26.4). Laboratory tests indicated elevated triglycerides (880 mg/dl) and abnormal liver function tests (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed multiple liver adenomas with diffuse steatosis. Investigation of diabetes showed an insulin level of 68 \u00b5IU/ml (normal range: \u2266 18.7 \u00b5IU/ml), with fasting blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dl (normal range: 70\u2013114 mg/dl).",

The patient was discharged after three weeks of residential treatment on 21 February 2017, having achieved a weight loss of 3.6 kg (a body weight of 97.8 kg and a BMI of 30.8 kg/m2). Immediately after discharge, the patient underwent a one-year standardised outpatient programme based on CBT-OB, during which he was encouraged to continue applying the procedures and strategies learned during his residential stay (e.g., self-monitoring, weekly weighing, meal planning, problem solving, and cognitive restructuring). The outpatient portion of the programme involved 12 individual CBT-OB sessions over the course of one year; the first four of these follow-up sessions were held every 15 days and then the remainder on a monthly basis. These outpatient sessions encompassed both the weight-loss phase (which lasts 6 months) and the subsequent weight-maintenance phase. Throughout the entire treatment (residential and outpatient), the patient took a mixture of essential amino acids (Aminotrofic\u00ae) (AFC) 8 g/day (i.e., leucine, lysine, isoleucine, valine, threonine, cystine, histidine, phenylalanine, methionine, tyrosine, and tryptophan with vitamin B6 and vitamin B1) as a dietary supplement.\\nThe patient completed the CBT-OB programme on 15 December 2017; at this time, his body weight had fallen to 94.2 kg and his BMI to 29.7 kg/m2\u2014a weight loss of 7.1%.

At the time of referral, the patient had been diagnosed with T2DM since 4 years and was under metformin medication (1000 mg twice daily) since 2 years. His further medication consisted of simvastatin 40 mg once daily, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg once daily, and ramipril 5 mg twice daily. A BMI of 28.4 kg/m2 and a waist circumference of 102 cm indicated overweight and abdominal obesity. Diabetes control was insufficient (HbA1c: 7.2%; fasting blood glucose: 6.6 mmol/L) and increased insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: 8.5) and dyslipidemia (total cholesterol: 7.4 mmol/L; LDL cholesterol: 4.9 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: 0.9 mmol/L; LDL/HDL ratio: 5.4; triglycerides: 3.0 mmol/L) were noted. His systolic blood pressure was 176 and diastolic blood pressure was 118 mmHg.\\nThe blood test revealed a total testosterone level of 11.1 nmol/L which was slightly below the normal range of 12 nmol/L as defined by the European Association of Urology, and thus testosterone therapy (TTh) was started with depot injections of testosterone undecanoate (intramuscular (i.m.) injections at 3-month intervals after an initial 6-week interval). Prior to each injection, the patient was routinely examined throughout the observation period of meanwhile 11 years and 9 months. Testosterone values were determined on two separate occasions before commencing TTh and then prior to each injection representing trough values. Right after the first injection, testosterone returned to the normal range and remained at that level throughout the observation time ().\\nDuring the first 4 years of TTh, the patient constantly lost weight (\u201310 kg) and waist circumference was reduced by 8 cm, resulting in a BMI of 25 kg/m2 ( and ()). The weight loss was sustained throughout the observation time, that is, the patient did not regain weight during the following years.\\nUnder TTh blood glucose level and lipid profile normalized progressively, HbA1c remained below 6.5% from month 21 onward and below 5.7% from month 36 onward; fasting blood glucose decreased to 6.0 mmol/L after 3 months, to below 5.7 mmol/L after 12 months, and then remained permanently below this value;",

As an infant she had hypoglycemic episodes resulting in seizures. A liver biopsy showed decreased G6PC enzymatic activity of 0.45 \u03bcmol/min/g tissue (N 3.50 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcmol/min/g tissue) with increased glycogen content. Gene analysis revealed a mutation of the G6PC gene homozygous for 50delGT, thus confirming the diagnosis of GSD-Ia.\\nInitially, our patient was managed with frequent feedings and by the age of 9, a night-time cornstarch regimen was initiated to prevent hypoglycemia. She had expected complications of the disease, including uric acid kidney stones, lactic acidosis, hepatic adenomas with hepatomegaly, and diffuse steatosis.\\nAt the age 31 years, our patient became pregnant and did not undergo routine gestational diabetes screening due to her underlying GSD. Three days prior to delivery, she was incidentally noted to be hyperglycemic for the first time, with a blood glucose more than 300 mg/dL (N 70\u2013140 mg/dL). The elevated glucose was attributed to gestational diabetes for which she was started on insulin. Treatment was complicated by severe hypoglycemia with a blood glucose of 32 mg/dL, and she subsequently refused all forms of insulin.\\nThereafter, our patient was lost to follow-up for 2 years. At the age of 33 years, she sought care when she had continued hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 13% (N 4.3\u20136.0%). On social history, our patient was working at an office job; she denied any toxic habits including smoking or alcohol use. There was no family history of consanguinity nor birth defects; her young child was healthy. She had a maternal grandmother with diabetes, and her mother had prediabetes. On examination, our patient had a BMI of 41.6, short stature, and generalized obesity. Her heart and lung examinations were unremarkable; she had an obese abdomen with hepatomegaly. A skin examination was notable for acanthosis nigricans, with scattered psoriatic patches. Neurologically, she was alert and appropriate, and her examination was non-focal. Laboratory tests were significant for elevated triglycerides of 960 mg/dL, with microalbuminuria, and otherwise normal liver function tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her abdomen showed multiple liver adenomas with diffuse steatosis. Further investigation of her diabetes showed an insulin level of 32 \u03bcIU/mL (n 1.9\u201323 \u03bcIU/mL), and a high c-peptide of 5.2 ng/mL (N 0.8\u20133.1 Ng/mL), with a fasting blood glucose of 311 mg/dL (N 70\u2013140 mg/dL). A homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR) calculation to determine insulin resistance was calculated as 24.6 (N <2.5), thus indicating severe insulin resistance []. Despite the diagnosis of diabetes, our patient continued her regimen of 5 tablespoons (tbsp) of uncooked cornstarch at night to prevent hypoglycemia from her underlying GSD.\\nWith initial lifestyle modifications, including a lower carbohydrate diet, exercise, and attempting weight loss, our patient\u2019s HgA1c improved from 13% to 11.9%. It was clear medication initiation was needed, however this was a challenge due to the patient\u2019s underlying chronic liver disease, lactic acidosis, and refusal of insulin. Due to liver dysfunction, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, a renally cleared medication, was trialed first. Our patient was treated with canagliflozin, with uptitration of the dosage to 300 mg daily. She concomitantly decreased her bedtime cooked cornstarch from 5 tbsp to 3 tbsp. With these interventions, after a few months, her HgA1c improved from 11.9 to 9% without episodes of hypoglycemia but notable elevation in lactate levels from 3.2 to 5.6 mmol/L (N 0.6\u20132.5 mmol/L).\\nFor more effective glycemic control, an alpha glucosidase inhibitor was added. A dose of acarbose 50 mg was started three times a day with meals. A continuous glucometer monitoring system (CGMS) 1 week after starting acarbose showed downtrending night-time blood glucose with an episode of hypoglycemia in the morning (see Fig. ). Omission of acarbose at dinner-time effectively eliminated fasting hypoglycemia. Overall, it took approximately 1 year to control her blood glucose, and at the age of 34 years, her diabetes was at goal, at which point our patient was concomitantly able to lose 11 lbs. A combination of canagliflozin, acarbose, and weight loss decreased her starting HgA1c from 13 to 6.5%.",

        "note": "A healthy 13-years-old boy presented with a tonic-clonic seizure, electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated generalized spike-wave discharges, suggesting generalized epilepsy and sodium valproate was initiated as therapy. His anthropometric parameters at presentation were: weight 45 kg and height 160 cm (Z-score \u22120.6 and \u22120.4, respectively) with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.6 kg/m2 (Z-score 0.5). The clinical exam and the cognitive development were normal at time of presentation. By 6 months, the patient was on triple therapy (sodium valproate, perampanel, clonazepam) for increasing seizures and myoclonus. Six months following the diagnosis of epilepsy, he was found to have fasting (6.8 mmo/L) and varying postprandial (11.1\u201313.8 mmo/L) hyperglycemia, and glycosuria without ketonuria (Table ). His past medical history was unremarkable, and he did not take other medications (apart from the antiepileptic medications) and had a negative family history for diabetes mellitus. His myoclonus worsened with progressive severe neurological sequelae (gait ataxia, loss of autonome ambulation, dysarthria, cognitive deterioration with extreme speech difficulties).\\nEvaluation of glucose metabolism showed fasting hyperglycemia (6.8 mmol/L), glycosuria, negative ketonemia and ketonuria, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.5%. The insulin secretion was preserved (15.7 mU/L, C peptide 0.93 nmol/L, fasting levels) with a HOMA-IR index (homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance) {calculated as [fasting glucose (mg/dl) x fasting insulin (lU/ml)/405]} at 4.76, suggestive of insulin resistance. The child did not display clinical features of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, abnormal adipose tissue distribution, or lipodystrophy) and his lipid profile and hepatic function were normal at presentation and remained so during the follow-up.\\nThe pancreatic autoimmune markers (ICA, GAD65, IAA, ZnT8) were negative. Testing for monogenic diabetes revealed no mutations in any of the known genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, ABCC8, KCNJ11, and INS). The diagnosis of diabetes was made, a basal-prandial insulin regimen started, and a normal glycemic profile was quickly obtained with a very low total daily dose of insulin (0.25 \u03bc/kg/d). The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) was not the right one, but at this point of diagnosis approach we were unable to define more precisely the association between the progressive myoclonic epilepsy and the hyperglycemia. Mitochondrial disease was also excluded.\\nSix months following the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, the patient was under 0.2 \u03bc/kg/d of long-acting insulin analog and showed an excellent glycemic profile (HbA1c 6%). Testing for autoimmune markers remained negative. A decision on continuing the same insulin regimen (only long-acting insulin analog) was encouraged.\\nTwenty four months following the first presentation and eighteen months after the diagnosis of diabetes, the patient's neurological status continued to worsen with a significant cognitive deterioration despite being under four antiepileptic drugs. His metabolic profile remained uncontrolled with persistent hyperglycemia (HbA1c 8.2%) and hyperinsulinemia (insulin 29.4 mUI/L, C peptide 1.62 nmol/L, fasting levels).\\nThe complex nature of the metabolic and progressive neurological disease (uncontrolled seizures and unexplained insulin resistance) mandated high suspicion and testing for LD. PAS positive LBs are typically found in the eccrine duct and apocrine myoepithelial cells of sweat glands (). An axillary skin biopsy was taken accordingly and revealing LBs within apocrine myoepithelium. Genetic testing displayed a homozygous mutation NHLRC1 c.386C > A, p.Pro129His, confirming the diagnosis of LD (Figure ).\\nAt the time of LD diagnosis, in the absence of any insulin regimen, a reevaluation of pancreatic insulin secretion demonstrated an increasing insulin resistance (insulin 29.4 mUI/L, C peptide 1.62\u20131.8 nmol/L).",

The patient\u2019s height was 171 cm, and her weight was 73 kg. Her menarche was at the age of 14. She had experienced menstrual irregularities for the last 5 years. In 2013, she had consulted a gynecologist about the absence of pregnancy and her menstrual irregularities. She was examined at that time and was diagnosed with primary infertility, endocrine; polycystic ovary syndrome; oligomenorrhea; insulin resistance; and moderate cervical dysplasia. The patient took oral contraceptives with antiandrogenic effect and a hypoglycemic agent from the biguanide group (metformin). Loop excision of the cervix was performed after preliminary treatment of the infection. Also, the patient underwent metrosalpingography, and her fallopian tubes were passable. In 2016, an ultrasound examination of the pelvic organs revealed an endometrial polyp. Hysteroscopy and polypectomy were performed. The diagnosis was histologically confirmed. In January 2017, the patient\u2019s ovulation was stimulated with selective modulators of estrogen receptors, after which pregnancy occurred. At 10 weeks of pregnancy, an undeveloped pregnancy that corresponded to 6 weeks was detected by ultrasound. A manual vacuum was carried out to aspirate the conception product from the uterine cavity with subsequent administration of an antibiotic. Since 2017, the patient had taken progesterone and cyproterone acetate in the second phase of the menstrual cycle. Menstruation was scarce from 2017 and regular only as a result of the hormone drug use.\\nIn 2018, the patient was referred to our clinic and complained of a lack of pregnancy for 1 year with a delay in menstruation of up to 2\u20133 months. Her menstruation was irregular, every 28\u201390 days for 3\u20134 days, painless, and scanty over the last year.\\nExamination with a speculum revealed that the cervical epithelium was not damaged; the discharge was milky in moderate quantities. Vaginal examination revealed the uterus in anteflexion; it was normal-sized, dense elastic, mobile, and painless. The patient\u2019s ovaries were palpated on both sides, slightly enlarged, of limited mobility, and painless. Laboratory test results were as follows: antimullerian hormone 10.5 ng/ml (normal value 0.4\u20136.96), follicle-stimulating hormone 6.9 mIU/ml (normal value in the follicular phase 3.5\u201312.5), luteinizing hormone 11.8 mIU/ml (normal value in the follicular phase 1\u201311.4), estrogen 50.6 pg/ml (normal value in the follicular phase 13.6\u2013190.4), prolactin 157 mIU/ml (normal value in the follicular phase 69\u2013750), progesterone 0.18 ng/ml (normal value in the luteal phase 1.83\u201323.9).",

        "note": "A female patient aged 12 years and 3 months was referred to the pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic from the cardiology department for her short stature. Birth was by normal vaginal delivery and was difficult but did not require the hospitalization of the infant. Birth weight was 2500 g. She was reported to have acquired head control by the 3rd month of life but was noted to be retarded in her neuromotor development at age 6 months and was able to walk at age 2.5 years. Hearing impairment was identified when she was 7 years old. Based on her Denver Development Test results which indicated defective neuromotor development, it was recommended that she receive special education. At age 11 years, she had been diagnosed to have aortic stenosis and was being followed by the cardiology department. Her two siblings and her non-consanguineous parents were healthy. The patient\u2019s weight was 41 kg [-0.8 standard deviation score (SDS)], height 133.5 cm (-3.5 SDS) and head circumference was 50 cm.\\nBone age was 11 years. Midparental height (MPH) was 151.8 cm (3-10p). At physical examination, abdominal obesity and scoliosis of the lumbar vertebrae were noted. Inspection also revealed a thin upper lip, prognathism and ear auricle anomaly. The 4th and 5th metacarpals of both hands were short and overriding of the toes was present. The thyroid gland was nonpalpable. Pubertal status was compatible with stage 3. A systolic murmur was heard in all heart focuses. Bilateral hearing loss and right nystagmus were also present. Laboratory examination results showed that serum lipid values were in the upper normal range (total cholesterol: 176 mg/dL, triglyceride: 187 mg/dL) and that her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was high (8.16 IU/mL). Her anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) level was 83.9 IU/mL and her anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) level was 92.6 IU/mL. Thyroid imaging revealed a thyroid volume of 7.3 mL. The patient was diagnosed to have Hashimoto thyroiditis and subclinical hypothyroidism and was started on L-thyroxine (L-T4). Immunoglobulin A (IgA) values were measured and found to be normal. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels were low (<-2 SD) for age.\\nAt follow-up, annual height growth rate was 6.5 cm/year. Weight gain was also found to be accelerated. At 13 years and 8 months, acanthosis nigricans appeared on the neck and armpits and striae in the lumbar regions. In a review of her history, no laboratory data suggesting iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s disease were found, but the patient had received local steroid treatment for atopic eczema for approximately 3 years.\\nMetformin therapy was started following determination of a peak insulin level of 400 IU/mL. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was measured at 5.7. The patient lost weight and IR regressed with treatment.",

        "note": "A 27-year-old African American female was referred for nephrotic syndrome in 2012. In 2005, during her first pregnancy, she had developed proteinuria and preeclampsia. The proteinuria subsided after she had given birth; however, it recurred during a second pregnancy in 2006 and increased to the nephrotic range. The second pregnancy was otherwise uneventful, and after delivery, the degree of proteinuria trended down to a nadir of 120 mg/g creatinine by 2009. She subsequently presented to our hospital in 2012 when the proteinuria again increased, reaching 4,600 mg/24 h (or 2,900 mg/g creatinine).\\nThe patient had no past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, or other systemic illnesses. She was not taking any medications, had no known allergies and denied ever smoking or having used illicit drugs. Of note, both her father and maternal grandmother had type 2 DM and her father had had a stroke at age 50.\\nOn examination, her blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg and her BMI was 33. There was no edema, acanthosis nigricans, or hirsuitism. Fundoscopy did not reveal any diabetic retinopathy. Laboratory values included 0.7 mg/dl serum creatinine, 167 mg/dl total cholesterol, 42 mg/dl HDL cholesterol, and 77 mg/dl triglycerides. Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria with no hematuria. Tests for HIV, RPR, HBV, HCV, ANA, C3, and C4 were all negative or normal. Fasting glucose was 80 mg/dl and HbA1C was 5.8%. Renal ultrasound revealed kidneys 12 cm in size.\\nA renal biopsy was obtained in October 2012. Of the 7 glomeruli present, none were globally or partially sclerotic. Glomerulomegaly was not present. Using an eyepiece micrometer, the mean glomerular diameter was 175 \u00b1 12 \u03bcm, a value within the reported normal range. One glomerulus evidenced segmental hyalinosis. Otherwise, the glomeruli were unremarkable by light microscopy (fig. ). Evidence of chronicity such as interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was absent. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed mild (1\u20132+) pseudolinear staining of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) for IgG. No other immunoglobulin classes or complement components were detectable. Electron microscopy showed that the lamina densa of the GBMs were diffusely thickened, averaging 700\u2013900 nm (fig. ). The podocytes were not vacuolated and, importantly, their foot processes were not effaced (fig. ). The endothelial cells were swollen with loss of fenestrations. Hyaline deposits were also noted in the glomerular capillary wall (fig. ), a finding corresponding to the light microscopic changes mentioned above.\\nOur patient was serially evaluated for impaired glucose metabolism. Fasting blood glucoses ranged from 80 to 111 mg/dl (with only two values \u2265100 mg/dl). HbA1C ranged from 5.6 to 5.9%. Fluorescein angiography was negative for diabetic retinopathy. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was normal with a 2-hour glucose level of 109 mg/dl.",

Physical examination carried out revealed unconsciousness, loss of cooperation and orientation, cold and sweaty body, arterial blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 124 pulse/minute and respiratory rate of 24/minute. The rest of the physical examination was normal. The measured serum glucose (PG) was 30 mg/dl. A bolus of 50% dextrose was administered immediately. The neurological, cardiac and pulmonary examinations and the laboratory tests were normal. The biochemical analysis of the patient's serum revealed normal sodium level. The patient's body temperature was normal and there was no evidence of infection. During the follow-up there was no hypotensive attack. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward with a diagnosis of hypoglycemia. The PG was measured hourly. Infusion of 20% dextrose was continued. At the end of first hour, the patient was reevaluated. His consciousness was clear and physical examination was normal. The patient's PG at the 1st hour was 146 mg/dl and he was clinically stable. 10% dextrose was administered slowly as an infusion. When the infusion was stopped, PG decreased rapidly, thus the infusion was continued for nearly 12 hours. No symptomatic hypoglycemia was observed thereafter, after stopping the infusion.\\nThe patient had been diagnosed with pre-diabetes before 2.5 years; his body mass index was 31.5 kg/m2. He was recommended diet, lifestyle changes, physical activities and metformin therapy. However, the patient was noncomplicated.

        "note": "A 71-year-old woman diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood glucose level of 118 mg/dL, (normal value \u02c2100 mg/dL) and insulin 14.4 \u00b5IU/mL (normal value \u02c27 \u00b5IU/mL) was admitted in our institution for professional assistance in December 2018. Her body weight was 90.3 kg (body mass index, BMI: 32 kg/m2) and body fat 42.7%. The patient also suffered of hypothyroidism and hypertension, which were medicated and controlled. To corroborate the diabetic state of the patient, we measured her sugar tolerance (glucose and insulin levels) after an oral challenge with 75 g of glucose and the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The obtained results showed that effectively, the patient was hyperglycemic (Figure , triangles) and hyperinsulinemic (Figure , triangles). The insulin resistance index of the patient was calculated by using the homeostasis model assessment (In HOMA-IR) and gave a value of 8.2 (normal values \u02c22.3). According to the diabetic state, the obtained value of HbA1c was 6.3% (normal values \u02c25.7%) (Table , Case 1). The prescribed treatment consisted in 850 mg/day of metformin and dietary intervention with a low-fat/low-caloric diet based on proteins and carbohydrates of low glycemic index. At the time of this treatment, the patient had normal hepatic function, AST: 25 (10-40) IU/mL, and renal function, creatinine: 0.71 (0.45-0.82) mg/dL. Diabetic complications (eg, retinopathy, dermopathy or neuropathy) were not observed. The medication for the preexisting hypothyroidism and hypertension was maintained throughout the intervention. The treatment was followed during 8 (eight) months with by-monthly controls. After this period (August 2019), the patient did not show significant improvement in her diabetic situation, despite she was committed to and attained whit the treatment (Figure , circles). The blood levels of glucose and insulin remained high and the HOMA-IR value was 7.9. Accordingly, the high levels of HbA1c remained unmodified (Table , Case 1). At this time, the body weight and body fat of the patient were 91.5 kg and 43.1%, respectively. Because of the treatment failure, we decided to incorporate the daily consumption of probiotic as a nutritional complement to the anti-diabetic therapy. For our study, we selected the probiotic spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis natto DG101. This probiotic bacterium is originated from the millennial Japanese natto food that is worldwide reported for producing different healthy effects on consumers, and we were intrigued to know if the natto strain might control the blood sugar and insulin levels. Therefore, the patient was prescribed with a daily dose of 2 mL (approximately 40 drops) of B subtilis natto DG101 at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 108 CFU (Colony Forming Units) per mL and 850 mg/day of metformin plus the original low-fat/low-caloric diet based on proteins and carbohydrates of low glycemic index. After 4 (four) months of treatment with metformin, modified diet and probiotic supplement, the blood levels of glucose and insulin decreased significantly to near normal values (95 mg/dL and 6.5 \u00b5IU/mL, respectively; Figure , squares).",

However, after three months, he was still symptomatic.\\nAs he had already failed to lose weight after being enrolled in a medically supervised weight-loss program (composed of a multidisciplinary team including a nutritionist, physical therapist, psychologist, and pediatric surgeon specialized in bariatric surgery), and exhibited a bone age of a 17-year-old, we indicated bariatric surgery. During this period, he and his family were encouraged to make lifestyle changes (healthy diet and physical activity). They were also followed monthly by a psychologist. The patient was treated with sibutramine, fluoxetine, and metformin, but showed no response. Our decision was taken after considering the criteria established by the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine guidelines to undergo bariatric surgery in adolescence, which the patient fulfilled. The family formally consented, and the patient assented to the procedure.\\nAt the age of 16 years and nine months, the patient underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Ophthalmologic evaluation, performed five months after surgery, revealed normal visual acuity in both eyes and improvement of bilateral papilledema (Figure 1B). Follow-up at 18 months showed a 67.5% loss of excess weight (weight: 94.5 kg and BMI: 31.2 kg/m2) and complete resolution of IIH symptoms.",

He had undergone left orchiectomy for a testicular tumor on the same side confirmed by frozen biopsy specimens. The histopathologic examinations indicated that the resected testicular mass was mature teratoma (0.30\u00d70.3 cm-sized) with severe testicular atrophy and surrounding tissue had a marked decrease in the number of germ cells (). On karyotyping, the patient was diagnosed with a typical type of KS with 47, XXY. Then, he was referred to our clinic for evaluation of his abnormal karyotype.\\nHis birth weight was 3.0 kg. There was no notable family history. His father and mother's height was 174 cm and 158 cm. His parent's pubertal developments were within normal range. Although he showed an average level of academic achievements, he was having difficulty forming normal peer relations because of his shy and passive characters. He had grown taller than his peers since early childhood. Since one year before our clinic visit, the patient had begun to markedly increase in stature and body weight with progressive pubertal changes in his external genitalia. Physical examination showed tall stature (158 cm, >97 percentile) with body weight of 64 kg (>97 percentile), increased body mass index (BMI) (25.6 kg/m2, 95th\u201397th percentile) and his waist circumference of 93 cm (>97th percentile; 50th percentile, 66.9 cm). His pubertal stages were the gonad on the right side of Tanner III (the right testicular volume 8 mL, penile length 8 cm, width 2.5 cm) and the pubic hair of Tanner II.\\nThe findings of initial blood examinations were as follows: hemoglobin, 13.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 40.1%; white blood cell counts, 7,680\u00d7103/\u00b5L; alkaline phosphatase, 1,415 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase, 35/24 IU/L; insulin-like growth factor-I, 441 ng/mL; beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG), 0.86 mIU/mL (normal range, 0.00\u20132.00 mIU/mL); \u03b1-fetoprotein, 1.2 mIU/mL (normal range, 0.0\u201320.0 mIU/mL).

Birth was by normal vaginal delivery and was difficult but did not require the hospitalization of the infant. Birth weight was 2500 g. She was reported to have acquired head control by the 3rd month of life but was noted to be retarded in her neuromotor development at age 6 months and was able to walk at age 2.5 years. Hearing impairment was identified when she was 7 years old. Based on her Denver Development Test results which indicated defective neuromotor development, it was recommended that she receive special education. At age 11 years, she had been diagnosed to have aortic stenosis and was being followed by the cardiology department. Her two siblings and her non-consanguineous parents were healthy. The patient\u2019s weight was 41 kg [-0.8 standard deviation score (SDS)], height 133.5 cm (-3.5 SDS) and head circumference was 50 cm.\\nBone age was 11 years. Midparental height (MPH) was 151.8 cm (3-10p). At physical examination, abdominal obesity and scoliosis of the lumbar vertebrae were noted. Inspection also revealed a thin upper lip, prognathism and ear auricle anomaly. The 4th and 5th metacarpals of both hands were short and overriding of the toes was present. The thyroid gland was nonpalpable. Pubertal status was compatible with stage 3. A systolic murmur was heard in all heart focuses. Bilateral hearing loss and right nystagmus were also present. Laboratory examination results showed that serum lipid values were in the upper normal range (total cholesterol: 176 mg/dL, triglyceride: 187 mg/dL) and that her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was high (8.16 IU/mL). Her anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) level was 83.9 IU/mL and her anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) level was 92.6 IU/mL. Thyroid imaging revealed a thyroid volume of 7.3 mL. The patient was diagnosed to have Hashimoto thyroiditis and subclinical hypothyroidism and was started on L-thyroxine (L-T4). Immunoglobulin A (IgA) values were measured and found to be normal. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels were low (<-2 SD) for age.\\nAt follow-up, annual height growth rate was 6.5 cm/year. Weight gain was also found to be accelerated. At 13 years and 8 months, acanthosis nigricans appeared on the neck and armpits and striae in the lumbar regions. In a review of her history, no laboratory data suggesting iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s disease were found, but the patient had received local steroid treatment for atopic eczema for approximately 3 years.\\nMetformin therapy was started following determination of a peak insulin level of 400 IU/mL.

When she was 3 years old, she visited our hospital because of hypoglycemia, liver enzyme elevation, and hepatomegaly. She was diagnosed as having GSD type Ia based on the loss of G6Pase activity in the liver (< 0.3 \u00b5mol/minute/g tissue).\\nIn the first stage of life (3 years to 6 years), she needed frequent feedings and a night time cornstarch regimen until 7 years of age. After 8 years of age, her hypoglycemia improved and her glucose levels could be maintained with cornstarch intake twice a day. However, she had several complications such as kidney stones and hepatic adenomas with hepatomegaly.\\nAt 20 years of age, her BMI increased (to 24.2) and she presented hyperglycemia after food intake (Fig. ). The blood glucose dynamics indicated type 2 diabetes mellitus as described in Fig. [Fasting glucose: 123 mg/dl, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 9.23]. Therefore, cornstarch feeding at night was stopped.\\nAt 40 years of age, she presented hyperglycemia (200\u2013260 mg/dl after feeding and dumping syndrome-like symptoms such as nausea, general fatigue, and dorsal pain). Moreover, the dumping syndrome-like symptoms worsened, resulting in poor quality of life. At first, she misunderstood that the complication was related to hypoglycemia and thus increased feeding, leading to an increase in body weight (maximum BMI was 26.4). Laboratory tests indicated elevated triglycerides (880 mg/dl) and abnormal liver function tests (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed multiple liver adenomas with diffuse steatosis. Investigation of diabetes showed an insulin level of 68 \u00b5IU/ml (normal range: \u2266 18.7 \u00b5IU/ml), with fasting blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dl (normal range: 70\u2013114 mg/dl). HOMA IR was calculated as 22.1 (N < 2.5), indicating severe insulin resistance.\\nAt first, she attempted lifestyle modifications such as a lower carbohydrate diet, elongation of feeding time, and exercise. However, her condition did not improve. To avoid severe hypoglycemia and improve liver function, she was experimentally treated with luseogliflozin hydrate additionally, an SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 2.5 mg daily, after obtaining informed consent. After this intervention, she decreased her cornstarch intake, and her dumping syndrome-like symptoms disappeared completely. In addition, her body weight (BMI 21) and insulin resistance both decreased remarkably.",

She had nystagmus and photophobia when she was 1 year old, which led to childhood blindness. She also presented with mild sensorineural hearing loss, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, renal dysfunction, and hypertension. Additionally, she had secondary amenorrhea caused by polycystic ovary syndrome since age 12. Her cardiac function was normal and did not have cognitive dysfunction or general intelligence impairment during her developmental period.\\nWhole exome sequencing revealed the patient to have a compound heterozygous mutation in the ALMS1 gene. The first mutation was a seven base pair deletion resulting in a frame shift that introduced a new stop codon at chr2: 73,680,067 (National Center for Biotechnology Information build, NCBI build 37) in exon 8 of the ALMS1 gene (c.6410_6416del, p.2137_2139del). The second mutation was a stop codon in exon 10 of the ALMS1 gene (c.8776C>T, p.R2926X) at chr2: 73,717,865 (NCBI build 37). As there was no consanguineous relationship, other family members did not showed features of Alstr\u00f6m syndrome. We confirmed these mutations by Sanger sequencing and found that the c.8776C>T mutation was maternally inherited (). The seven base pair deletion might have been either inherited from the patient's father or newly introduced as a de novo mutation.

        "note": "Following an ischemic stroke, the 44-year-old female patient was under out-patient observation for suspected PFO and was referred to the Department of Invasive Cardiology in order to undergo further diagnostics.\\nEight months previously, the patient suffered from an ischemic stroke with right-sided hemiparesis and motor aphasia. At the time, computed tomography revealed a small hypodense focus (approx. 8 mm in diameter) in her white matter, on the left side, near the body of the lateral ventricle. No other abnormalities were found during ultrasonographic evaluation of the brain-supplying arteries and transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination. During the hospitalization, the patient began motor rehabilitation and speech therapy, which were continued on an out-patient basis after her discharge from the hospital. After several months, her neurological symptoms abated completely. The search for the causes of the stroke was continued in out-patient conditions. After excluding hematological disturbances (antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombophilia, hormonal contraception), PFO was considered to be the most likely suspect. The TEE with contrast and the Valsalva maneuver was performed, but the suspicion was not confirmed. Furthermore, the patient had never smoked cigarettes, and, apart from small varicose veins of the lower legs, no other cardiovascular risk factors were found. After the patient's medical history was analyzed at the Department of Invasive Cardiology, PFO appeared to be the most probable cause of the stroke. The patient was qualified for an invasive examination.\\nOn admission to the clinic, the patient was in good general condition, arterial pressure: 131/94 mm Hg, in ECG: normal sinus rhythm (69 bpm), normal axis. Apart from small varicose veins of the lower legs and slight obesity (body mass index (BMI) 31 kg/m2), physical examination revealed no neurological defects or other abnormalities. Similarly, no abnormalities were found by basic laboratory tests evaluating the patient's morphology (hemoglobin: 12.2 g/dl, erythrocytes: 4.41 million/\u03bcl, leukocytes: 7.63 thousand/\u03bcl, thrombocytes: 339 thousand/\u03bcl), coagulation system (fibrinogen: 371 mg/dl, INR: 1.00, APTT: 26.7 s), electrolytes (sodium: 138 mmol/l, potassium: 4.36 mmol/l), renal parameters (creatinine: 0.77 mg/dl), hepatic parameters (alanine aminotransferase: 9 IU/l), and lipid profile (total cholesterol: 171 mg/dl, HDL: 49 mg/dl, triglycerides: 67 mg/dl).",

The patient reported that he was lying in bed watching television when he suddenly started feeling intense substernal chest pain. He described the pain as if someone was kicking him in the chest, rating the pain at 8/10 in severity. The pain was non-radiating, not reproducible, and without any alleviating or aggravating factors. It was associated with diaphoresis and one episode of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. The patient reported that he was smoking marijuana just one hour prior to the onset of the chest pain. His social history was significant for smoking marijuana six to seven times a day for the past 20 years, he was a social alcohol user, and denied any other illicit substance abuse, including cocaine.\\nInitial vital signs were within normal limits with blood pressure (BP) at 116/81 mmHg, an oral temperature of 36.2\u00b0C (97.2\u00b0F), a pulse of 61 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97%. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a significant ST depression in V3 and V4 which is shown in Figure .\\nInitial troponin was found to be mildly elevated at 0.044 ng/mL by laboratory standards but was clinically negative for myocardial infarction. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabinoids only. However, based on the EKG findings and symptomatology, the patient was treated as non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) team was activated. He was administered 325 mg of aspirin and 180 mg of ticagrelor and taken for PCI. He was found to have 100% stenosis (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow 0) of the first obtuse marginal (OM) artery and the right coronary artery. An EluNIR\u2122 (Cordis, Santa Clara, CA) 2.5 x 24 mm drug-eluting stent (ridaforolimus) was placed in the first OM as it was thought to be the culprit lesion causing the symptoms. Pre and post-PCI catheterization images are shown in Figure .\\nThe patient reported that his chest pain was relieved after the procedure. EKG showed complete resolution of the ST depressions after PCI. Troponin was measured again post-procedure and found to be 27.9 ng/mL where it peaked. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 61%. However, it did show akinesis of the mid-inferolateral walls and features consistent with a pseudonormal left ventricular filling pattern, concomitant abnormal relaxation, and increased filling pressure consistent with a Grade II diastolic dysfunction.

        "note": "A 50-year-old African-American male with no significant comorbidities and not on any medications presented to the emergency department with complaints of three days of worsening epigastric pain. The pain was dull, non-radiating and 10/10 in intensity, associated with nausea and three episodes of vomiting. There was no history of similar pain episodes in the past. He was a chronic smoker and consumed a bottle of beer a few days in a week with the last drink six days prior to presentation. On examination, the patient was found to have a BMI of 29. He was in distress due to pain (10/10) but was alert and oriented. The patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 102 beats/minute; other vitals were stable. An abdominal examination revealed epigastric tenderness with no rebound tenderness and negative Murphy's sign. Bowel sounds were sluggish with no palpable organomegaly or lumps. Cardiovascular and respiratory system examination revealed no abnormalities.\\nThe patient was kept nil by mouth, and aggressive intravenous fluids were administered. Morphine was given for pain. Investigations were ordered in the line of the acute abdomen. Lipase was high: 1796 U/L (normal range 0-160 U/L). Other significant lab findings were leukocytosis of 12,800 per cu mm (normal range:4500-1100 per cu mm), hematocrit of 47% (normal range 40-54%), and blood glucose of 300 mg/dl. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.1 (normal pH:7.35-7.45), HCO3 of 8.3 mEq/L (normal range 22-28 mEq/L), and PCO2 of 20 mm Hg on room air (normal range: 38-42 mm Hg). Besides sodium (Na) of 132 mEq/L (normal range 135- 145 mEq/L), all other electrolytes were normal. HBA1c was 10.7% (normal range: 4-5.6%). All these metabolic abnormalities were questionable given the mild presentation of acute pancreatitis. However, urinalysis showed ketonuria and glycosuria. Based on lab parameters and ABG analysis, a diagnosis of DKA was made. He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. Insulin infusion and IV fluid were started. Meanwhile, imaging finding by ultrasonography (USG) abdomen showed inflamed pancreas and no gallstones. CT of the abdomen (Figures -) showed inflammation surrounding the pancreas compatible with acute pancreatitis. No focal fluid collection was seen. No other acute abnormalities were observed in the abdomen or pelvis. Lipid profile showed a high TG level of 1226 mg/dl.",

On admission his Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 7/15 (eye 1, verbal 2, and motor 4). Neurological examination revealed bilateral symmetrical sluggish pupils of 3 mm. We could do only a limited neurological examination due to low GCS. He moved all four limbs to a painful stimulus and the deep tendon reflexes were normal. Bilateral flexor plantar response was present. With the suspicion of any drug overdose, a urine sample for toxins was sent urgently, but all the tested toxins including opioids, benzodiazepines and amphetamines were negative. An urgent NCCT brain was done within two hours of symptom onset to exclude intracranial hemorrhage and it turned out to be normal.\\nAfter four hours of admission, his GCS improved to 11/15 (E3V2M6). However he was drowsy and there was bilateral asymmetrical ptosis, right more than left. Third nerve palsy without pupillary involvement was evident on the right side. Right eye medial and downward gaze were impaired. He also had bilateral upward gaze palsy, but had no nystagmus (Fig. ). These findings suggested a right-sided nuclear third nerve palsy. He did not have pyramidal or cerebellar signs and the visual fields were normal.\\nAs the NCCT brain was normal, we proceeded with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) brain. It was reported as acute infarction in bilateral paramedian thalami and medial rostral mid brain, suggesting AOP territory infarction. MRA showed hypoplastic right vertebral artery. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images and diffusion weighted images (DWI) showed the paramedian thalamic infarctions in the index case due to AOP involvement. Here the rostral mid brain involvement is asymmetrical as was suggested by the clinical findings as well (Fig. ).\\nOver a week, his hypersomnolance gradually improved but his diplopia persisted. After the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, the underlying risk factor assessment was performed. He had hypertension, but no diabetes mellitus.",

She reported two recent ischemic stroke hospitalizations over the preceding 3 months and that she was fully compliant with her ongoing post-stroke medical management. Initial non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for hemorrhage or evidence of acute ischemia, but did demonstrate regions consistent with her prior infarcts in the right fronto-parietal regions. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy was not administered secondary to timing and improving symptoms. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 8 with left-sided hemiparesis and paresthesias involving face, arm, and leg.\\nFurther review of her prior history revealed that approximately 3 months before her current presentation she had experienced acute onset of left lower extremity weakness with imaging demonstrating scattered ischemic infarcts in the right frontal lobe. At that time, aspirin and statin therapy was initiated and she was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. Two weeks later, while at the rehabilitation facility, she experienced acute left facial droop and left upper extremity weakness with no sensory loss or neglect with imaging demonstrating new scattered ischemic infarcts involving the right fronto-parietal region and corona radiata. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head demonstrated marked irregularity of the right A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). There was also calcification in various bilateral cerebral vessels without flow-limiting stenosis. Intracranial atherosclerosis was hypothesized as the likely culprit of her recurrent strokes and dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated; she continued on her statin. After a short course of rehabilitation she was discharged home. She then presented to our facility approximately three months after the initial stroke.\\nDuring her hospitalization in our facility, work-up revealed a hemoglobin A1C of 4.7%.",

Current medications included clozapine 150 mg by mouth at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily, docusate 100 mg by mouth twice daily, and cholecalciferol 2000 units by mouth daily. He tried and failed multiple antipsychotics prior to initiation of clozapine 4 years ago. His mental health had been stable since initiating clozapine, and he resides in a group home. He gained 9.5 kg the year after clozapine was initiated, and then weight stabilized. He had difficulty controlling his diet at the group home and ate what was prepared for him. Despite lifestyle education, he continued to visit the vending machine frequently for soda (2 cans per day), candy bars (1 per day), and chips (1 bag per day). He was referred to a dietitian but was unable to successfully implement dietary changes. He did not have access to exercise equipment at his group home and did not walk outside due to inclement weather. He was referred to an exercise program located in the same facility as the clozapine clinic but did not attend the appointments. Metformin initiation for weight management and prediabetes was recommended at several appointments, but he declined because he preferred not to take more medications. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day and was not interested in smoking cessation services.\\nHis resting BP was elevated at his past 2 appointments (136/84 and 136/86 mm Hg), so the nurse at his group home had been recording daily BP readings in a log. His BP log revealed an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg.

She was not a candidate for Alteplase (tPA) due to recent stroke and current use of apixaban.\\nShe has a history of hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation diagnosed in 2017 (paroxysmal AF with spontaneous reversal at the time of diagnosis and which was initially treated with 2.5 mg of apixaban twice daily) with 1 prior cardiovascular accident (CVA) in the left frontotemporal infarction seen on MRI on 08/09/2019, no tPA was administered.\\nEarlier that evening prior to arriving to the ED, the patient was eating dinner and abruptly noticed that she had tonic jerky movements of her left hand which she could not control. The episode lasted a few minutes. Subsequently, she noticed right facial droop, slurred speech and expressive aphasia. She denied diplopia or difficulty swallowing. She denied weakness in her extremities. She endorses previous history of abrupt onset expressive aphasia which lasted 3-4 days or so during the CVA on 08/09/2019 (positive on MRI as stated above). She was on apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day (BID) by mouth (p.o.) at the time which was increased to 5.0 mg BID p.o. upon discharge. Physical examination was grossly unremarkable other than noted left corner of the mouth facial droop and slurred speech per the admitting physician. NIHSS stroke scale was 2.\\nIn the ED, an electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus rhythm with heart rate of 89 beats per minutes, right bundle branch block, T wave inversions in inferior leads and poor R-wave progression as read by the cardiologist. The report of the brain computed tomography (CT) without contrast obtained at 19:33 showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift or mass effect but revealed age indeterminate infarct in the left frontal lobe per the reading radiologist. CT angiography performed at 19:51 reported no focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm involving the anterior and posterior circulation of the brain nor any hemodynamically significant stenosis or occlusion involving the major arterial vessels of the neck. Brain MRI ( and ) performed at 22:05 revealed subacute infarct in the left frontal lobe at the gray-white matter junction. There was an acute infarct involving the right frontotemporal cortex just above the right sylvian fissure and chronic ischemic changes and cortical atrophy. An echocardiogram performed on 09/23/2019 at 21:54 reported an ejection fraction estimated at 60-65% with grade I diastolic dysfunction and no gross regional wall motion abnormalities. There was aortic valve calcification without hemodynamically significant stenosis.\\nLaboratory findings were grossly unremarkable: white blood cell (WBC)=7.1 10*3/ uL, hemoglobin (Hb)=13.0 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct)=38.3%, platelets (PLT)=250 10*3/ uL, prothrombin time (PT)=13.1 seconds (secs), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)=30.6 secs, INR=1.0.

Hepatocytolysis enzymes were grossly unremarkable (AST 35, ALT 83, Alkaline phosphatase 103). She was administered 324 mg of aspirin orally and admitted for further evaluation.\\nRegarding clinical and pharmacological history at the time of this current presentation, for anticoagulation due to her history of AF, she was on apixaban 5 mg p.o. daily (qd). For rate control, she was reportedly on oral diltiazem 120 mg daily and for rhythm control, oral sotalol 80 mg BID. In addition, the patient was on rosuvastatin 20 mg daily qd p.o for cardiovascular event prevention and metoprolol succinate 25 mg qd p.o. for hypertension. Canaglifozin 300 mg p.o. daily and sitagliptin 100 mg p.o. daily for diabetes. Levothyroxine 88 mcg p.o. daily for hypothyroidism. For the past month prior to this ED visit, she had been complaining of headaches localized over the forehead, more so on the left side, off and on. She has history of chronic headaches in the past and was diagnosed to have temporal arteritis. She was followed by a rheumatologist and treated with oral methotrexate 2.5 mg daily and 12.5 mg once a week on Thursdays as well as oral prednisone 2-3 mg a day. She suffers from major depressive disorder and was on oral paroxetine 20 mg once daily.\\nUpon admission, most of the aforementioned medications were withheld except for apixaban, metoprolol and paroxetine. Permissive hypertension was allowed for the first 24 hours. The patient\u2019s BP remained in systolic BP between 125-170 and diastolic between 55-77 during that timeframe.

She initially presented with right-sided neck pain, which she attributed to various physical activities and sleeping in uncomfortable hotel beds. Of note, she described multiple recent visits to a theme park and enjoyed numerous roller coaster rides. The pain was achy, constant in nature, extending to the back of the eyes, and rated as 4 on a 10-point scale. Her pain persisted and increased in severity despite acetaminophen use and application of heating pads. She then tried block therapy, yoga, and deep tissue neck massage. The pain then became bilateral, even more severe, followed by an episode of severe dizziness and nausea which prompted the emergency room visit. Her family history was negative for connective tissue diseases. The patient was taking oral contraceptive pills and had discontinued statin therapy a few years ago. She denied using tobacco products, illicit drugs, or excessive alcohol.\\nInitially, vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed a nontoxic appearing young woman in no visible distress. Neck exam was significant for muscular tenderness but no midline or cervical spinous process tenderness. There was no rigidity, with full active and passive range of motion without pain. Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. The ear canals showed no abnormalities; there were no hearing deficits. No carotid bruits were present, and the neck was supple. Neurological exam revealed a normal cranial nerve exam, +5/5 muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities symmetric bilaterally, normal sensory exam, normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing, and no dysdiadochokinesia.

Review of systems noted a history of 40 pounds weight loss over 3 months, drenching night sweats and occasional low grade fevers for last 3 months. Past medical history was significant for multiple episodes of renal colic secondary to nephrolithiasis treated with lithotripsy several years ago. Social history was significant for 30 pack year history of smoking, occasional alcohol consumption and no substance abuse or high risk behavior. Family history and medication history were not contributory. At the time of presentation patient was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure (BP) of 78/49 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 59 mmHg. The hypotension was new compared with recent admission 3 weeks prior, where the BP readings were consistently above a MAP of 80. The hypotension did not correct with bolus of 3 liters of 0.9% normal Saline (NS) and in view of his history of dysuria and intermittent hematuria and recent diagnosis of staghorn calculus he was diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) leading to urosepsis and septic shock. He was admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU) where he was started on pressor support with norepinephrine and broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Vitals recorded at presentation were temperature of 97.3\u00b0F, BP of 78/49 mmHg, MAP of 59 mmHg, heart rate 80/min, respiratory rate 18/min, SpO2 of 98-99% on room air. General exam was significant for an averaged sized man in mild distress with mild pallor, no icterus, cyanosis or edema. Systemic exam was significant for mild right costovertebral angle tenderness. Labs were significant for hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.2 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 77.6 fL and leukocyte count (WBC) of 5.1 k/\u00b5L with differential of 77% neutrophils. Liver enzymes showed alkaline phosphatase of 212 U/L, Alanine transaminase (ALT) 80 U/L, Aspartate tranaminase (AST) 96 U/L, Total protein 3.6 g/dL and albumin 1.5 g/dL. Urine dipstick was positive for blood (1+), proteins (30) and glucose (50) and urine microscopy showed 109 RBC and 12 WBC. Rest of the lab results are shown in . Cortisol level at admission was 182.6 mg/dL which ruled out adrenal insufficiency. Two sets of blood culture and urine culture were done prior to starting antibiotics which showed no growth after 5 days of incubation. CT scan abdomen done at presentation showed numerous ill defined lesions in the liver which were new from the CT scan done 3 weeks before for evaluation of renal colic (). The study redemonstrated the staghorn calculus with no evidence of obstruction, no radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis or renal abscess. Patient received 2 days of pressor support with Norepinephrine drip, following which his blood pressure improved to a MAP over 70 mmHg, however he continued to have intermittent episodes of hypotension which were managed with frequent boluses of 1000 to 500 mL of 0.9% NS. Interestingly, on Day 5 of admission, patient developed increased shortness of breath and became hypoxic. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram done at bedside showed normal ejection fraction and normal inferior vena cava. Patient was diagnosed with fluid overload secondary to frequent fluid boluses and was given one dose of 20 mg i.v. lasix which led to resolution of shortness of breath. During this entire stay, he continued to have intermittent episodes of hypotension with mean arterial pressure dropping to low 60\u2019s. Colonoscopy and esophago-gastro-duo-denoscopy (EGD) done as part of malignancy workup, showed 2 polyps which were diagnosed as tubular adenoma and thick gastric folds with chronic gastritis on histopathology respectively. A liver biopsy was planned after improvement in his overall condition however on day 9 of the hospitalization patient declined the procedure and requested a break from the hospital. Liver biopsy was deferred for a later date and patient was discharged in a stable condition. During this admission 4 blood cultures and 3 urine cultures did not show any growth after 5 days of incubation. He was discharged with oral levofloxacin to complete a course of 14 days of antibiotics for complicated UTI. Three days after being discharged from hospital, patient returned to emergency room with similar complaints of acute onset weakness and fatigue and a single episode of fever for which he received a single dose of Ibuprofen at home. Vitals at presentation showed rectal temperature of 94.1\u00b0F, BP of 84/49 mmHg, breathing at rate of 18/min, heart rate 59/min and saturating 97% on room air.",

Auscultation of the lungs revealed pulmonary congestion.\\nHis laboratory investigations were as follows: hemoglobin 9.1 g/dL, total leukocyte count 23,200/cmm, platelet count 592,000/cmm, BUN 65 mg/dL, creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 95.3 mEq/L, bicarbonate 13.8 mEq/L, total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.3 mg/dL, SGOT 32 IU/L, SGPT 25 IU/L, ALP 210 IU/L, total proteins 7.7 g/dL, albumin 3.1 g/dL, C-reactive protein 142, amylase 71, lipase 82, procalcitonin 1.4. His urine microscopy revealed trace proteins with entire field full of pus cells. A chest radiograph confirmed pulmonary edema. His abdominal sonography was unremarkable except for moderate ascites. CT-abdomen and pelvis revealed acute pyelonephritis with perinephric fat stranding.\\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Diuretic therapy was intensified (frusemide infusion), he was put on noninvasive ventilation, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were administered (meropenem, teicoplanin, aztreonem). His urine culture came positive for Escherichia coli, whereas blood culture was sterile. He continued to have high-grade fever and went into septic shock, with the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score of 21 and the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 9. He was intubated, put on ionotropic support, and antibiotics were changed according to sensitivity reports (tigecycline, colistin, vancomycin, clindamycin). His blood pressure stabilized at 100/50 mmHg on dopamine infusion at 20 \u03bcg/kg/min, noradrenaline at 15 \u03bcg/kg/min, adrenaline at 0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min, and vasopressin at 0.02 U/min. He was initiated on sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (SLED), following anuria, worsening azotemia, and severe metabolic acidosis. In view of on-going sepsis and unstable hemodynamics, decision was taken to initiate him on direct hemoperfusion using PMX-DHP.\\nAfter priming the cartridge and blood lines, 2 hrs of direct hemoperfusion was performed using a blood flow rate of 100 mL/min and heparin anticoagulation. Twelve hours after the initiation of PMX-DHP therapy, vasopressin and adrenaline infusions were tapered, and there was a noticeable improvement in his urine output. 24 hr after initiation of PMX-DHP, vasopressin and adrenaline infusions were stopped. After another 24 hours, the dopamine and noradrenaline doses were decreased, and the urine output increased to approximately 0.7 mL/kg/hr. Under these conditions, the heart rate was maintained at 110 bpm; blood pressure 135/60 mmHg.",

Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) showed subtle signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with some frontobasal subarachnoid blood (). CT angiography revealed a 4-mm aneurysm of the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA). At admission her blood pressure was 128/55 mm Hg. On the first day of admission her mean arterial pressure (MAP) varied between 81 and 99 mm Hg, with a mean of 88 mm Hg. She had no history of hypertension, was no taking any medication, and exhibited a good neurological condition (Hunt and Hess grade of 1).\\nThe aneurysm was coiled on the same day. The procedure took longer than usual (2 hours) because of the smallness of the aneurysm, which made it difficult to enter it safely with the microcatheter. During the procedure, both internal carotid arteries were catheterized to optimize depiction of the local vascular anatomy (). However, a microcatheter was only advanced in the left ACA to reach the aneurysm. According to the local protocol, 5000 IE of heparin was given during the procedure; no other medication was given during the procedure. The aneurysm was successfully packed with two small coils (3 cm long; 2-mm UltraSoft, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) using a left approach. No complications were noted and the patient experienced no focal neurological symptoms.\\nAfter the procedure the patient developed periods of bradycardia with sinus arrest in the intensive care unit (ICU) but without clinical symptoms. There were assumed to be secondary to the SAH, and were treated conservatively. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) performed during the following week showed mildly increased flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) that were just within the normal range (111 and 82 cm/s in the left and right MCAs, respectively), suggesting mild vasospasm. Oral nimodipine at 30 mg taken 12 times daily and triple-H therapy were started according to the local protocol. On day 4 of the triple-H therapy the MAP reached 72-108 mm Hg (mean 93 mm Hg). Slight lung edema was treated with furosemide. TCD performed 5 days later showed normal MCA velocities, although the velocities in the MCA and ACA continued to be higher on the left than on the right, albeit still within the normal range. Triple-H therapy was subsequently stopped. During the hospital stay the clinical status of the patient improved and her headaches gradually diminished. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition after 12 days with a prescription for oral nimodipine (60 mg taken six times daily for 20 days).",

As an embassy member in a sub-Saharan African country, he left Africa one month prior to admission to our hospital. Our physical examination revealed a pulse of 150/min and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg. Auscultation of the chest revealed ubiquitous wheezing and normal heart sounds without presence of murmurs. The skin was dry, but with no erythema. The abdomen was soft with no rebound tenderness. The liver was not enlarged and the spleen was not palpable. Neurological examination showed no focal neurological signs and no signs indicative of meningitis. The Glasgow Coma Scale was 11. Laboratory evaluation revealed a free hemoglobin of 48.2 \u03bcmol/l, total bilirubin of 59 \u03bcmol/l and lactate dehydrogenase of 16.8 \u03bcmol/l*s, indicative of ongoing hemolysis. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were markedly elevated, and the patient showed a severe thrombocytopenia. Lactate was 7.5 mmol/l, base excess-4.5 mmol/l, anion gap 16.6 mEq/l and pH 7.43, indicative of a compensated metabolic acidosis. The presence of malaria falciparum parasites could be detected by microscopical examination of a thick blood film. The chest X-ray was normal. The patient received 500 ml of cristalloids and 1 gm paracetamol intravenously and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\\nIn the ICU, a central venous catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein and a catheter for pulse contour analysis and continuous hemodynamic measurement was placed into the left femoral artery. The patient received colloids, crystalloids and a continuous infusion of glucose 10% under concurrent laboratory control of glucose, arterial blood gases, lactate and electrolytes every 4 hours. Two units of platelets were transfused. Quinine (QuinimaxR) was administered intravenously, starting with a bolus injection followed by continuous infusion over 24 hours under regular control of quinine blood levels. Additionally doxycycline was given orally. The first hemodynamic measurement revealed a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, cardiac output of 6.0 l/min and a systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 729 dynes*s/cm2. CVP was measured every 4 hours. During the first 14 hours in the ICU, the overall fluid administration was 4.7 l and diuresis was 3.6 l, resulting in positive fluid balance of 1.1 liter. The heart rate decreased to 120 beats/min and the systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased to 100 mmHg.",

A craftsman had been unable to meet the owner of the house several times on the agreed date and alerted the emergency services. When the man was found, the sauna door was closed, and the sauna showed a temperature of 78 \u00b0C. The upper body was lying on the right side of the first bench with the legs stretched out in the middle of the sauna. The body had already begun to decay and the skin was partially mummified. The man was a recovered alcoholic, and no other previous illnesses were known.\\nThe autopsy was conducted promptly. The man had a body weight of 73 kg and a body length of 179 cm. The autopsy revealed an advanced decayed body with partly leather-like dried skin (Fig. ). The assessability of the internal organs was considerably limited because of the putrefaction and heat-related hardening and dehydration. Moderate general arteriosclerosis and coronary sclerosis, thickening of the left ventricular wall (approx. 2 cm) as a sign of arterial hypertension, cholecystolithiasis, and gastritis were found. The spleen was already liquefied. There were no indications for death-related violence. Histological examinations of the heart tissue showed a fatty degeneration of the myocardium and coronary sclerosis.

        "note": "A 59-year-old woman with a previous history of coronary artery disease with posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 2015 requiring percutaneous intervention to the right coronary artery (RCA) and proximal circumflex via right femoral arterial access presents with chest pain. Her other comorbidities include hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, and active smoking. She presented to the emergency room 7 h after the onset of acute chest pain and shortness of breath. An initial electrocardiogram in the emergency department demonstrated ST elevations in leads V1\u2013V4, consistent with an anterior STEMI. Emergent coronary angiography through right femoral artery access demonstrated a thrombotic occlusion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD). She was also noted to have a 90% stenosis in the mid RCA. A Resolute Onyx (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) 2.5 \u00d7 15 mm drug-eluting stent was placed successfully in the LAD with restoration of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow.\\nShortly following intervention to the LAD, the patient developed rapid progressive hypotension and subsequent ventricular fibrillation arrest. Despite ongoing advanced life support protocol, the patient was unable to re-gain a perfusing rhythm. In consideration of Impella placement, right femoral angiography was performed and revealed diffuse vasospasm with lack of flow distal to the 6-Fr sheath in the right common femoral artery. Right subclavian artery access was attempted, but unsuccessful. Given ongoing cardiac arrest and lack of peripheral access options, the decision was made to proceed with emergent transcaval access for Impella CP\u00ae placement.\\nIn addition to the 6-Fr sheath in the right common femoral artery, a 7-Fr sheath was placed in the right femoral vein. Abdominal aortic angiogram showed normal caliber aorta with minimal disease. Through the 7-Fr venous sheath, a 6-Fr renal length IMA guide catheter was advanced in the inferior vena cava at the L3 vertebral level. A 6-Fr JR4 guide catheter was then advanced into the descending aorta, and a 20 mm Gooseneck snare was advanced into the descending aorta at the L3 vertebral level. The IMA guide catheter was then directed towards the Gooseneck snare, with positioning confirmed on both AP and lateral views (Figure A). A mother\u2013daughter system was utilized with an Astato XS 20 wire inside a piggyback wire inside a Navicross catheter. The mother\u2013daughter system was then delivered to the tip of the IMA catheter. The back end of the Astato XS 20 wire was then activated with 50 W via an electrosurgical pencil on cut mode, with successful penetration across the IVC into the descending aorta. The Astato wire was then captured with the Gooseneck snare and advanced up the descending aorta. The piggyback wire and Navicross easily followed and the wires removed and Lunderquist wire delivered to the ascending aorta via the Navicross. The Navicross, IMA catheter and 7-Fr sheath were then removed from the right femoral vein, and a 16-Fr Cook sheath was then advanced through the R femoral vein and across the IVC into the descending aorta. A 5-Fr pigtail catheter was then delivered via the transcaval access and used to cross the aortic valve and deliver an 0.18\u2033 wire into the left ventricle. The Impella CP\u00ae was then advanced over the wire to proper positioning within the left ventricle.\\nShortly after placement and activation of the Impella CP\u00ae, the patient\u2019s haemodynamics improved and return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. Repeat coronary angiography showed acute in-stent thrombosis of the mid LAD stent. Following aspiration thrombectomy, a second Resolute Onyx 2.5 \u00d7 12 mm drug-eluting stent was successfully placed in the mid LAD with return of flow achieved. Upon transfer from the cath lab to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU), the patient remained haemodynamically stable and demonstrated purposeful movements following prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She underwent successful transcaval closure with Amplatz 10/8 ADO (Abbott, Santa Clara, CA, USA) 48 h after Impella CP\u00ae insertion (Figure ). Unfortunately, she developed unexpected recurrent cardiogenic shock and died days later.\\nA 67-year-old man with history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, active smoking, with known coronary artery, and peripheral arterial disease presents with acute chest pain. He has a history of plain old balloon angioplasty to left circumflex artery and RPLB with four Xience drug-eluting stents to his RCA in 2017 via right radial artery access. On his last heart catheterization, RCA vasospasm was seen in the setting of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with access again through his right radial artery. Initial EKG in the field demonstrated ST elevation in leads V1, V2, and V3 which resolved on admission to the emergency room.\\nAn hour later, patient\u2019s chest pain returned with intermittent complete heart block and new inferior ST elevation seen on electrocardiogram. He was taken to the catheterization lab where he developed cardiac arrest. CPR was initiated and patient was defibrillated for ventricular fibrillation. While anaesthesia was intubating the patient, right femoral artery access was attempted. Given the difficulty in advancing the wire, angiogram was done which showed complete occlusion of the right iliac artery (Figure A). The left iliac artery was similarly occluded (Figure B) and right radial and brachial access was unsuccessful with no pulsation seen on ultrasound.\\nAfter 45 min of CPR with persistent ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia arrest, left axillary artery access was attempted. An 18 gauge needle was inserted under ultrasound with guidewire with angiogram demonstrating patency of the axillary and subclavian arteries (Figure ). Subsequent Impella CP\u00ae sheath placement was successful (Figure ). Impella CP\u00ae was delivered to the left ventricle over a 0.018\u2033 wire. The mean arterial pressure increased to 80 mmHg with pulse regained minutes afterwards.\\nAfter return of spontaneous circulation, the right axillary artery was accessed under ultrasound guidance with insertion of a 6-Fr sheath for a left heart catheterization. Coronary angiogram showed patent right coronary arteries. There was spasm noted in the distal RCA that improved with intracoronary nitroglycerine similar to his last heart catheterization. Patient was transferred successfully to the ICU haemodynamically stable. He survived to discharge with no access site complications.\\nA 55-year-old man with diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and no prior cardiac history presented with shortness of breath, syncope, and exertional chest pressure. He underwent urgent heart catheterization for unstable angina. Angiography demonstrated chronic total occlusion (CTO) of his mid RCA. His culprit lesion was suspected to be an 85% stenosis of the obtuse marginal branch of his left circumflex artery. Patient underwent successful PCI with two overlapping Promus (2.5 \u00d7 20 mm and 2.5 \u00d7 16 mm) drug-eluting stents.\\nThe next day, intervention was attempted on the CTO of the RCA. The Asahi Fielder XT 190 cm guidewire was advanced across the lesion. However, there was failure to cross the CTO with a micro catheter and balloon. Patient developed cardiac arrest during the procedure requiring 5 min of CPR with initial ventricular rhythm. Post arrest, he returned to his baseline and did not require intubation.\\nThe following morning, patient became unresponsive when he walked to the restroom. Cardiac arrest protocol was initiated when nursing staff could not palpate a pulse. Initial code was PEA arrest for 5 min until return of circulation. Patient was transferred to the ICU where he developed refractory PEA arrest. An automated chest compression device was placed with decision by cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology to proceed with emergency ECMO.\\nGiven challenges from morbid obesity and haematoma from recent catheterizations, femoral arterial access was unsuccessful. Left axillary artery became an option given the severity of disease and lack of other viable access sites. Under ultrasound, arterial access was gained with a guidewire placed down the left axillary artery. The vessel was dilated and a 15-Fr Bio-Medicus cannula was placed with venous cannulation from the femoral vein. Flow increased to 4 L/min and pressures increased allowing discontinuation of the CPR machine.",

        "note": "A 61 year old man presented to emergency room with history of flank pain on right side, dysuria, urgency and frequency with occasional hematuria for 3 days associated with fever, chills and rigors. 3 weeks before this presentation he was admitted for renal colic and was found to have a new staghorn calculus in the kidney which was managed conservatively with 7 days of oral antibiotics. Review of systems noted a history of 40 pounds weight loss over 3 months, drenching night sweats and occasional low grade fevers for last 3 months. Past medical history was significant for multiple episodes of renal colic secondary to nephrolithiasis treated with lithotripsy several years ago. Social history was significant for 30 pack year history of smoking, occasional alcohol consumption and no substance abuse or high risk behavior. Family history and medication history were not contributory. At the time of presentation patient was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure (BP) of 78/49 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 59 mmHg. The hypotension was new compared with recent admission 3 weeks prior, where the BP readings were consistently above a MAP of 80. The hypotension did not correct with bolus of 3 liters of 0.9% normal Saline (NS) and in view of his history of dysuria and intermittent hematuria and recent diagnosis of staghorn calculus he was diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) leading to urosepsis and septic shock. He was admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU) where he was started on pressor support with norepinephrine and broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Vitals recorded at presentation were temperature of 97.3\u00b0F, BP of 78/49 mmHg, MAP of 59 mmHg, heart rate 80/min, respiratory rate 18/min, SpO2 of 98-99% on room air. General exam was significant for an averaged sized man in mild distress with mild pallor, no icterus, cyanosis or edema. Systemic exam was significant for mild right costovertebral angle tenderness. Labs were significant for hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.2 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 77.6 fL and leukocyte count (WBC) of 5.1 k/\u00b5L with differential of 77% neutrophils. Liver enzymes showed alkaline phosphatase of 212 U/L, Alanine transaminase (ALT) 80 U/L, Aspartate tranaminase (AST) 96 U/L, Total protein 3.6 g/dL and albumin 1.5 g/dL. Urine dipstick was positive for blood (1+), proteins (30) and glucose (50) and urine microscopy showed 109 RBC and 12 WBC. Rest of the lab results are shown in . Cortisol level at admission was 182.6 mg/dL which ruled out adrenal insufficiency. Two sets of blood culture and urine culture were done prior to starting antibiotics which showed no growth after 5 days of incubation. CT scan abdomen done at presentation showed numerous ill defined lesions in the liver which were new from the CT scan done 3 weeks before for evaluation of renal colic (). The study redemonstrated the staghorn calculus with no evidence of obstruction, no radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis or renal abscess. Patient received 2 days of pressor support with Norepinephrine drip, following which his blood pressure improved.",

        "note": "A 17-year-old male was brought to the trauma bay after he suffered a drowning event. The previously healthy patient was submerged under seawater for approximately 5 min, was pulseless after extrication, and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at the scene by emergency personnel. Emergency personnel were able to achieve a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) doing only chest compression and manual ventilation within minutes of initiating CPR. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at intubation were performed, and a supraglottic airway was placed at the scene. The patient was then transferred to our center with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. On arrival, the patient's heart rate was 107 beats/min with blood pressure of 135/86 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 93%\u201394% while receiving manual ventilation. The patient was endotracheally intubated on arrival, and the initial trauma survey was negative for other injuries. The initial chest X-ray performed showed a reticular nodular pattern, and bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates that could be indicative of pulmonary edema [].\\nA few hours after being admitted, the patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) began to trend downward. Factors that could explain the suspected respiratory failure were saltwater drowning or postobstructive pulmonary edema after the failed intubation at the scene, which could both contribute to ARDS. Ventilatory support was increased to maintain a PaO2 above 60 mmHg, but inevitably, the patient required high ventilatory support with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, and FiO2 at 100%. Severe ARDS was diagnosed based on a PaO2/FiO2 of 60, the acuity of respiratory deterioration, and the imaging findings consistent with bilateral opacities. At this time, the patient was also initiated on inhaled epoprostenol 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min and required norepinephrine 12 \u03bcg/min and vasopressin 2.4 U/h.",

        "note": "The patient was a 59-year-old man from the town of Jeli in Malaysia. Jeli lies on the edge of the Belum-Temengor rainforest, one of Malaysia\u2019s national reserves bordering Thailand. Gradual urbanization over the past few decades has made this town an outbreak area of dengue and leptospirosis.\\nThe patient was admitted with fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and poor oral intake over the 6 days prior to admission. He was given antipyretic and amoxicillin by his general practitioner, but his condition had worsened. No blood investigation was done. On the day of presentation, he had difficulty in breathing and was referred to hospital.\\nAt the emergency department, the patient was conscious but lethargic. He was mildly dehydrated, blood pressure (BP) was 102/78 mmHg and heart rate was 104 bpm. Capillary refill time was less than 2 s with a high, spiking temperature of 40 \u00b0C. He was mildly jaundiced and abdomen was soft with no organomegaly. There were no signs of haemorrhagic manifestation. Respiratory rate was 35 breaths/min and oxygen saturation (SPO2) was 93% on ambient air. Lungs were clear and breath sounds were equal bilaterally. He had type I respiratory failure, with arterial blood gas (ABG) pH of 7.36, PaCO2 at 25.6 mm Hg, PaO2 at 77.4 mm Hg, bicarbonate at 21.2 mmol/L, and lactate at 1.8 mmol/L on face mask oxygen of 5 L/min. Non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support was required to improve oxygenation. Bedside abdominal ultrasonography performed showed no hepatosplenomegaly with a normal biliary tract. Inferior vena cava (IVC) was collapsed at 0.88 cm, with a collapsibility index of more than 50%. Fluid challenge with normal saline was initiated and titrated up to 10 mL/kg/h.\\nInvestigations done in the emergency department revealed a platelet count of 33 \u00d7 109/L and a haematocrit (HCT) level of 39.4%. A rapid test using immunochromatic technique (ICT) was positive for dengue non-structural protein1 (NS1) antigen; similarly, the serologic Anti-DENV Immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing. International normalized ratio (INR) was 1.23 and aPTT was 44.3 s. Other laboratory investigation results included: haemoglobin (14.3 g/dL), red blood cell (RBC) count (4.55 \u00d7 1012/L) and white blood cell (WBC) count (6.91 \u00d7 109/L). Hyponatraemia (131 mmol/L) was present and liver function test was deranged with a total bilirubin of 46 mmol/L, alanine transferase of 77 mmol/L and alkaline phosphatase of 151 mmol/L (Table ). A blood film for malaria parasites was not carried out.\\nThe patient was diagnosed as a severe dengue case and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer observation. Bedside echocardiography revealed a normal cardiac function and IVC had picked up to 1.9 cm with the collapsibility index reduced to less than 50%, which corresponded to an improved volume status. However, the serum lactate level was still increasing, acidosis worsening and urine output decreasing. Further fluid challenge was administered carefully up to 50 mL/kg over 8 h with regular IVC assessment. Intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 g daily, was initiated by the physician to cover the possibility of concomitant leptospirosis because the patient was from an outbreak area.\\nOn the following day, the patient\u2019s oxygenation deteriorated and NIV support had to be increased gradually. Under an FiO2 of 60%, ABG showed: pH 7.247, pCO2 30.4 mmHg, pO2 100 mmHg, HCO3 16.1 mmol/L and lactate 3.5 mmol/L. A chest radiograph repeated the following day showed the presence of perihilar haziness and increased pulmonary vascular markings (Fig. b). The patient\u2019s platelet counts dropped further to 17 \u00d7 109/L but there was no sign of spontaneous bleeding. He also went through a few hypotensive episodes where the BP dropped to 85/50 mmHg.",

His medical history included hypertension (HTN), transient ischemic attack (TIA) x 1, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In the preanesthesia testing clinic, a 2/6 diastolic murmur was auscultated. An externally performed transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 65%-70%, dilated right ventricle (RV) with normal systolic function, severely dilated left atrium, heavily calcified mitral annulus and valve leaflets, and severe MS (area 1.47 cm2, mean gradient 14 mmHg). There was concurrent mild aortic stenosis (valve area 1.83 cm2, mean gradient 19 mmHg), mild mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 67 mmHg. Given his aggressive cancers and lack of symptoms, a decision was made to proceed to the operating room (OR) without further testing or intervention. Initial preoperative vitals were blood pressure (BP) 134/77 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 85 beats per minutes (bpm), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 94% on room air. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm (SR) with first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and right bundle branch block (RBBB).\\nIn the OR, standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors were applied. Defibrillator pads were placed, and amiodarone was available. A pre-induction arterial line was placed with 1% subcutaneous lidocaine. After preoxygenation, the patient was induced and intubated with intravenous (IV) lidocaine 60 mg, etomidate 20 mg, succinylcholine 100 mg, and fentanyl 250 mcg in rapid succession. Esmolol was given for a total of 40 mg IV to maintain a heart rate less than 70 bpm during laryngoscopy. The patient was placed on a low tidal volume strategy 6 mL/kg, relatively high respiratory rate, an inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 4. The goal was to keep intrathoracic pressures low to avoid increasing RV afterload and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and decreasing RV preload. An arterial blood gas was obtained 30 minutes after intubation to calibrate the end tidal CO2 to the pCO2 and check the pH. Norepinephrine and epinephrine bolus syringes and infusions were prepared. An eight-French (FR), 16-cm double lumen central venous line was inserted into the right internal jugular vein using ultrasound. The arterial and central lines were connected to an MICM device.\\nInitial readings showed central venous pressure (CVP) of 21 mmHg, cardiac index (CI) of 2.5 L/min/m2, stroke volume variation (SVV) of 3, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 1296 dynes-s/cm5.",

Preoperative examination revealed history of exertional breathlessness and chest discomfort since 12 weeks of gestation which gradually occurred on less than ordinary activities with progression of pregnancy. There were no symptoms suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, or congestive heart failure. Echocardiography revealed severe mitral regurgitation, moderate mitral stenosis (MS) (mitral valve area [MVA] 1.2 cm2, Pressure gradient 20 mmHg), moderate aortic regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] 75 mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 52% with mild LV systolic dysfunction). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with bifid P waves []. Hematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limit. She was prescribed tablet metoprolol 25 mg twice daily, tablet frusemide 20 mg twice daily, pentids 400 mg twice daily, salt restriction, bed rest, and was considered to be at a high cardiac risk for pregnancy.\\nIn the operating room, standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors were applied. Clinical examination revealed bilateral basal crepitations, tachypnea, noninvasive arterial blood pressure (BP) 113/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 96/min, regular in rhythm, and SpO2 100% in room air. Central venous cannulation was performed through the right internal jugular vein for perioperative central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. Baseline CVP was 7 cm of H2O.\\nA graded epidural anesthesia was planned to maintain hemodynamic stability and to maintain optimum systolic BP, diastolic BP, HR, CVP, and prevent further rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Epidural catheter was inserted through L1-L2 interspace with the patient seated and was placed 4 cm into the epidural space. Position was confirmed following administration of a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine with adrenaline. The patient was placed in the supine position with a left tilt of 15\u00b0 to prevent aortocaval compression and a sensory block to T6 dermatome was achieved by 12 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine in fractionated doses of 3 ml over a period of 20 min with 50 \u03bcg fentanyl. Oxygen was administered by a face mask at 6 l/min throughout the intraoperative period. IV fluid infusion was guided by continuous monitoring of CVP. Arterial cannula for invasive BP monitoring was not instituted due to logistic constraints. It should be preferably used, if possible. A male baby of 2.2 kg with Apgar score 9 and 10 at 1 min and 5 min, respectively, was delivered.

He initially noticed weakness in his right-hand grip that gradually progressed over the next 6 to 8 months to involve the left hand and eventually both arms, to the extent that he was unable to hold objects or elevate his arms. He also complained of a tingling and burning sensation in both hands. His family had noticed mild bilateral facial weakness, described as reduced facial expression, without dysphagia or dysarthria. He did not complain of any lower extremity weakness or sensory symptoms. There was no bowel or bladder dysfunction, and he denied any erectile dysfunction. Prior to evaluation, he had been experiencing orthostatic intolerance that worsened to the point that he became non-ambulatory. His family had also noticed cognitive decline over the last year, with frequent forgetfulness and slow thought processing. On systems review, he reported mild xerostomia and xerophthalmia without dysphagia.\\nA general physical examination, including cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems, was normal. On initial neurological examination, he was awake, alert and oriented to person, place, time and situation. He had a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 16 out of 30, with deficits primarily in the visuospatial, executive and delayed recall domains. On cranial nerve examination, he had preserved pupillary responses, visual fields were full on confrontational testing, and he had normal fundoscopy bilaterally. His extraocular movements were preserved. He had bilateral facial weakness (facial diplegia) and decreased subjective sensation to light touch and pinprick in the left trigeminal nerve distribution. He did not have any hearing impairment and his uvula and palate elevated symmetrically. He did not have any weakness in his sternocleidomastoid, trapezius or tongue muscles. On motor testing, there was decreased tone in his upper extremities, with bilateral shoulder girdle and intrinsic hand muscle atrophy. On confrontational strength testing (based on the six-point Medical Research Council scale), he had normal neck flexion and extension strength. He had near symmetric proximal and distal weakness in the upper extremities, with strength of two to three out of five in all muscle groups tested, slightly worse on his right (Table ). His strength was normal in his lower extremities.\\nOn multimodal sensory examination, he had subjectively decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in his left radial nerve, left median nerve and right axillary nerve distributions. A sensory examination of his lower extremities was normal. His triceps and patellar reflexes were diminished bilaterally, with preservation of his other myotactic stretch reflexes. His plantar responses were flexor bilaterally, and he did not demonstrate any frontal cortical release signs. Automated blood pressure and heart rate measurements performed at the bedside with postural change demonstrated severe orthostatic hypotension with sympathetic \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic compromise as follows: supine blood pressure, 142/90mmHg with heart rate 68 beats/minute; sitting blood pressure, 97/64mmHg and heart rate 77 beats/minute; standing blood pressure, 65/40mmHg and heart rate: 81 beats/minute.",

She had no history of spinal surgery or chronic back pain. She did not have any history of implanted devices/prostheses (peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), central line, orthopedic implants, pacemaker, etc.), and the patient was not immunocompromised. She endorsed sharp midline pain in her mid-thoracic spine which was non-radiating. On physical examination, she was neurovascularly intact with 5/5 strength in all muscle groups of her lower extremities, intact rectal tone, but was tender to palpation over the midline of her mid-thoracic spine. She had no long-tract tension signs and was not hyperreflexic. Laboratory findings were notable for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 112 (reference < 20) and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 16.5 (reference < 0.5). Blood cultures were obtained as part of infectious work-up which remained negative throughout the patient\u2019s hospital course. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) () was obtained that demonstrated findings consistent with T5\u2013T6 osteodiscitis without any evidence of cord compression or cord signal. The decision was made to treat conservatively with antibiotics in the setting of no cord threatening lesion, normal neurovascular exam, and morbidity associated with surgery. She was admitted to the hospital and was started on empiric broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics which were continued for 36 h with continued fevers and without significant improvement in symptoms. In an effort to help guide targeted antibiotic therapy, a CT-guided bone biopsy was performed by musculoskeletal radiology. The intent was for the sample obtained to be used in confirmation of diagnosis and also for bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. The biopsy was performed under general anesthesia due to the patient\u2019s body habitus, inability to tolerate prone positioning for the duration of the biopsy, and anxiety. The procedure was performed without technical difficulty. is an axial image from the patient\u2019s CT scan during the biopsy which demonstrates appropriate needle positioning during the procedure as described in the technical literature.\\nImmediately following the biopsy and after anesthesia emergence, the patient reported an acute change in neurologic status. Immediate physical examination revealed complete loss of motor function in the bilateral lower extremities, T5 sensory level with absent posterior and lateral column/tract sensation (proprioception, pinprick, temperature), intact anterior spinothalamic tract (light touch), intact rectal tone, and present bulbocavernosus reflex (ASIA B). An emergent MRI revealed no evidence of cord signal abnormality or compressive epidural hematoma (). The patient\u2019s examination rapidly deteriorated to complete flaccid paralysis and loss of all sensation below the T5 level over the next 60 min (ASIA A). The patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close neuromonitoring.",

He was very active, working as a tennis instructor without any neurological deficits. On exam, motor/sensation was fully intact throughout both upper and lower extremities, with no upper motor neuron signs. He was classified as American Spinal Injury Association class E, Nurik Grade 0, with a full mJOA score. Despite this, the patient had failed conservative measures such as over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, but had not received prior spinal injection nor surgical intervention. Advanced imaging was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was notable for a cystic mass within the spinal canal on the right side posterior to the C6 vertebral body, causing spinal cord compression and right neural foraminal stenosis (, ). This was attributed to synovial facet cyst formation. Given failed conservative measures, patient preference, and clear evidence on imaging, surgical intervention was recommended. The surgical plan was for C6 laminectomy decompression, right-sided C6-7 foraminotomy, and surgical excision and biopsy of mass under general anesthesia with intraoperative neuromonitoring.\\nThe C6-7 laminectomy and foraminotomy were performed and the cystic mass was visualized on the right side, compressing the dura. The mass was isolated and excised. Pathology revealed a synovial cyst. Motor and sensory evoked potentials remained at baseline with no changes throughout the entire procedure. Estimated blood loss was 100 cc. A subfascial drain was also placed which was removed on POD2. Output was 275 cc in the first 24 h, and then slowed to 40 cc over the second 24 h. Approximately 45 min after the procedure, he had full strength and sensation in the bilateral upper and lower extremities.\\nTwo hours postoperatively; the patient complained that he was unable to move his arms or his legs after being sat up by nursing staff.

Full dose of dexamethasone was given to the mother prior to delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and intubated because of respiratory distress within the first 30 minutes of life. Pulmonary hemorrhage presented shortly after high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Inhalational nitric oxide was applied because of PPHN from day 3 to day 7. He received 2 doses of surfactant, umbilical venous catheter (UVC), and umbilical artery catheter (UAC) were conducted thereafter to monitor central artery pressure.\\nDuring the first 3 days, HC 2 mg/kg q8 h was given intravenously because of circulatory failure indicated by hypotension responsive to substantial fluid administration and intensive inotropic support. When the epinephrine and dopamine requirement were reduced, HC was weaned gradually over a period of 5 days. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) raised up to 92 mmHg from day 7 and remained at 85 \u00b1 7.4 mmHg until discharge. The patient also accepted blood exchange and albumin (2 g as a total dose) because of hyperbilirubinemia (greatest indirect bilirubin 434 \u03bcmol/L).\\nAcute hypokalemia arised on day 14, serum potassium decreased to as low as 2.1 mmol/L. Potassium replacement was given as 0.3 mmol/kg/h intravenously, as well as oral repletion 4 mmol/kg/d in divided doses. Serum potassium was between 2.8 and 3.3 mmol/L in the following 2 weeks and remain normal thereafter.\\nFetal echocardiography had been performed at 24 weeks of gestation, which showed a structurally normal heart without ventricular hypertrophy. The first pediatric cardiology consultation was requested at day 1. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed 3 mm right-to-left shunting of blood across the foramen ovale and a large patent ductal arteriosus (PDA) with bidirectional shunting. The second TTE, performed at day 3, indicated mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 35 mmHg, LVEF 67% and similar atrial left-right shunt and patent ductal shunt when PPHN was persistent. At day 11, PPHN was ameliorated clinically, and the mean PAP had decreased to 23 mmHg suggested by 3rd TTE. The thickness of the interventricular septum (IVS) was normal at all these abovementioned TTE.\\nEchocardiography was repeated at day 30 because of profound cardiomegaly indicated at chest film and auscultation of a grade III/IV harsh systolic ejection murmur. This TTE showed severe thickening of the IVS (13.8 mm, z score = 8.29) and mild thickening of the posterior left ventricular wall (LVPW, 6 mm). Thicken of the ventricle affect the septum more than the ventricular free wall (IVS/LVPW 2.3, Fig. A and B). For children, IVS z-score of \u22652 related to body surface area is compatible with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Outflow tract obstruction was not observed, with a peak velocity of 0.85 m per second. Aortic coarctation (COA) was ruled out. Prenatal history was negative for maternal risk factors as well as the familial history regarding genetic and metabolic diseases, sudden death, or syncope history. Maternal oral glucose tolerance test and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were normal (Fig. ).\\nPropranolol (0.2 mg q8 h) and captopril (0.02 mg q8 h) were administrated. 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic monitoring demonstrated no arrhythmia.

Three days before ICU admission the patient was well during a routine follow-up visit at the nephrology department. He had undergone living donor kidney transplantation one month previously and the double J urethral catheter stent that was inserted after kidney transplantation was still in place. The patient was diagnosed with AIDS ten years before this when he presented with intestinal Kaposi sarcoma and candida oesophagitis. His HIV infection was suppressed (viral load < 20 copies/mL of blood, CD4 count 525 per microliter) at the time of kidney transplantation. Other comorbidities included type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy diagnosed in 2014 and coronary artery disease (last percutaneous coronary intervention seven years before).\\nThe patient`s HIV infection was treated for the last four months with an integrase strand inhibitor (dolutegravir 50 mg/d) plus a NRTI backbone including lamivudine (150 mg/d) and abacavir (600 mg/d).

She reported taking approximately 300 mg of amlodipine 10 h prior to admission. The patient\u2019s other medications included oxycodone, docusate, ibuprofen, and pantoprazole, all of which she reported taking as prescribed. On presentation, the patient was alert and oriented with a Glascow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. Vital signs showed a noninvasive blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg with no other abnormality. Examination revealed equal and mildly diminished radial pulses, normal heart rate and rhythm, clear lung fields, sluggish bowel sounds, no peripheral edema and no pallor. Initial laboratory results included an unremarkable complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel showing a sodium of 136 mmol/L, potassium of 5.3 mmol/L, chloride of 102 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 17 mmol/L, urea nitrogen of 22 mg/dL and a creatinine of 1.58 mg/dL (baseline 0.44 mg/dL). Further, urinalysis on admission was remarkable for the presence of ketones. Urine and serum toxicology including salicylate and acetaminophen were negative. Procalcitonin was 0.1 ng/mL and lactic acid was 2 mmol/L. Cardiac troponins were trended and were not elevated. Activated charcoal was not administered on admission due to the amount of time that had passed from ingestion to presentation. The patient was admitted to the medical transitional care unit for observation.\\nThe medical intensive care team was notified 7 h after admission when the patient\u2019s noninvasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell to the low 50s and was not responsive to fluid resuscitation and her mental status deteriorated to a GCS of 7. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where she required intubation for airway protection, had two central lines placed for medication compatibility concerns, and had an arterial line placed. In the ICU, lactic acid was found to be 6.4 mmol/L, and arterial blood gas showed a pH of 6.95, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 43 mmHg, a partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 79 mmHg, and calculated bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L on 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Electrocardiogram at that time showed normal sinus rhythm, rate of 72 beats per minute, QTc of 408 ms, and low voltage in precordial leads.\\nA dopamine drip (10 \u03bcg/min titrated to 20 \u03bcg/min at maximum) through peripheral line, glucagon drip (5 mg loading dose followed by 5 mg/h drip), and a bolus of 3 amps of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (150 mEq NaCO3 in 1L) in 1L D5W were subsequently started. After central access was obtained, calcium carbonate (12 mg/hr), norepinephrine (starting at 75 \u03bcg/min titrated up to 100 \u03bcg/min at maximum), epinephrine (5 \u03bcg/min titrated up to 10 \u03bcg/min), dobutamine (10 \u03bcg/kg/min titrated up to 25 \u03bcg/kg/min), methylprednisolone (100 mg every 8 h), and phenylephrine (100 \u03bcg/min) were started in rapid succession. Despite these interventions, arterial line MAPs were ranging between 45 and 60. Poison control was consulted and recommended continuing calcium carbonate while monitoring ionized calcium every 2 h, along with the bicarbonte drip in D5W, and glucagon drip. They also recommended starting an insulin drip which was administered per hospital ICU protocol targeting blood glucose of 180 mmol/L. Hemodynamic state was monitored using an arterial line and target MAP was >65.\\nCardiology was consulted and performed a stat two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed mildly reduced left ventricular contractility with the ejection fraction measured at 51%. Methylene blue (2 mg/kg administered over 1 h) and vasopressin (0.04 units/min at set rate) were started per cardiology\u2019s recommendations.",

        "note": "History and examination\\nA 41-year-old Hispanic male originally presented to the neurology service for evaluation of low back pain with a burning sensation in bilateral lower extremities. During the exam, it was noted he had brisk reflexes. Therefore, the neurologist recommended a cervical MRI which ultimately demonstrated severe cervical stenosis at C1 with severe cord compression (Figure ). The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic where he endorsed inability to carry things for long periods of time due to hand weakness that had been worsening over six months. Moreover, he stated that he was unable to perform his job as a butcher due to inability to hold his knife. Upon reviewing the patient's MRI and based on clinical exam of hyperreflexia throughout, bilateral clonus, bilateral Hoffman's, and 4+/5 strength in bilateral deltoids and grip, it was quickly determined that the cervical cord decompression was a priority, and he was scheduled for a C1 laminectomy with intraoperative neuromonitoring.\\nOperation\\nPrior to positioning as well as intraoperatively, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were present, equal, and reproducible in all four extremities. Anesthesia was asked to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 85 mmHg throughout the entire surgery. After removal of the posterior C1 arch, all SSEPs and MEPs were still present and reproducible. Shortly thereafter, the neuromonitoring technician was manipulating the needles in the scalp and when asked the reasoning, we were informed that SSEPs were gone from the hands, followed by all extremities, followed by loss of MEPs in the upper extremities. At that time, we stopped all surgical manipulation, and the MAP was confirmed to be greater than 85 mmHg that we requested at the beginning of the case.",

Patient's medical history was unremarkable, except for arterial hypertension treated by atenolol. Symptoms started acutely a few hours earlier, with a progressive loss of verbal contact. On admission, the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) score was 9/15 (E4, V1, M4), with moderate neck stiffness. There was no lateralized deficit and pupils were mid-size, reactive, and symmetric. Vital signs were as follows: body temperature of 36.6\u00b0C, arterial blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg, heart rate of 120/min, and respiratory rate of 60/min. A brain computed tomography (CT) without iodinated contrast agent (CA) perfusion before lumbar puncture did not reveal any significant abnormality. Intubation was required because of progressive respiratory distress. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed white blood cells (WBC) count at 560/\u03bcl, with 99% granulocytes, proteins at 1264 mg/dl, glucose at 3 mg/dl, and lactate at 27 mmol/l.\\nThe CSF and blood cultures grew positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae sensitive to penicillin G and ceftriaxone. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.016 mcg/ml for penicillin G and ceftriaxone in the CSF and 0.012 and 0.008 mcg/ml in blood for penicillin G and ceftriaxone, respectively. Treatment combining dexamethasone (10 mg q6h for 4 days) and ceftriaxone (2 g q12h for 14 days) was initiated. CSF analysis was repeated after 10 days and confirmed both a drop in WBC count and eradication of the causative microorganism.\\nThe patient was subsequently referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because of worsening of GCS score at 6/15 (E1, V1, M4).

        "note": "A 34-year-old woman with severe Crohn\u2019s disease, grade IV endometriosis, and bilateral tubal obstruction, booked for antenatal care at 13 weeks gestation. This was her first pregnancy following four attempts of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF). Routine antenatal blood investigations were unremarkable. Her blood group was A-negative. Pregnancy was uncomplicated until 17 weeks gestation when she presented with spontaneous PPROM. This was confirmed by the presence of a pool of clear liquor in the vagina and a positive nitrazine test. High vaginal swab cultures for bacteria were negative. Ultrasound scans confirmed a singleton pregnancy with oligohydramnios. There was complete anhydramnion at 19 weeks gestation, and this rendered assessment of foetal anatomy difficult.\\nThe couple was counselled on the poor outcome and risks of infection to the mother and foetus but expressed the wish to continue with the pregnancy. The risks of significant perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity associated with chronic anhydramnios and the poor outcome associated with extreme prematurity was fully discussed by the neonatal team. The risks were based on the risk of infection to both mother and the foetus, up to date evidence and the ultrasound findings.\\nShe was commenced on erythromycin 250 mg eight hourly, and managed expectantly as an outpatient with twice daily temperature checks at home, as well as serial full blood counts (FBC), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and weekly low vaginal swabs. Two weekly growth scan showed a normally growing foetus, with visible breathing movements, and chest circumference growing along the 50th centile. Abdominal circumference (AC) measurement in foetuses with oligohydramnios may be technically difficult and less reproducible as the abdominal profile may be significantly deformed due to compression, thus, it is probably more reproducible to use ratios based upon head circumference rather than AC as the fetal head is more rigid, even in such conditions []. Liquor volume was never measurable due to continuous amniotic fluid leak and anhydramnios.\\nShe remained well until 24 weeks gestation when she was admitted into hospital following a painful antepartum bleed. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of chorioamnionitis. She was managed conservatively, with bed rest in hospital, and prophylactic antibiotics. Two doses of 12 mg intra-muscular. Betamethasone were given at 24 weeks, 24 h apart, in order to facilitate foetal lung maturity, and minimise neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Anti D immunoglobulin was also administered to prevent rhesus isoimmunization. She remained in hospital and pregnancy continued largely uneventful until 28 weeks gestation when she had a major placenta abruption; associated with foetal heart decelerations on the cardiotocogram. A live male infant weighing 1100 g was delivered by emergency caesarean section, with an Apgar score of 4 at 1 min. He was electively intubated immediately and given a dose of surfactant. A diagnosis of pulmonary hypoplasia was made on the basis of immediate onset of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) requiring high ventilator pressures and no improvement in oxygenation or lung compliance after two doses of surfactant.",

He also had a history of atrial fibrillation, post defibrillator placement for cardiomyopathy, and history of sudden cardiac deaths in the family and was on rivaroxaban.\\nHe was initially started on low-dose prednisone and methotrexate for sarcoidosis, which precipitated his first sickle cell crisis in more than a decade. He presented with pain and anemia, with his hemoglobin falling from a baseline of 8 to 6 g/dL requiring blood transfusions. His liver panel showed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 213 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 68 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 373 U/L, total bilirubin of 26.3 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin of 22.7 mg/dL, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Liver biopsy showed exuberant granuloma with sinusoid sickling. Rivaroxaban was changed to warfarin after discussion with the family, mainly for the convenience of monitoring and reversing coagulopathy if needed.\\nHe was admitted within a year of initial diagnosis of sarcoidosis for progressively worsening limb edema and ascites. Furosemide and spironolactone had minimal response. He had a large-volume paracentesis performed, which revealed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The appearance of Ascitic fluid was orange in color with total nucleated cells of 26433/mm3 among which total nucleated cells were 60/mm3 L with 81% polymorphs. He was also found to be encephalopathic, and lactulose was initiated. Other causes of acute liver failure, including paracetamol ingestion, were ruled out because the levels were undetectable. Also, the patient was never found to have adverse effects of incompatible blood transfusion. Hepatitis C virus was negative and serum albumin was 2.9 mg/dL, with partial thromboplastin time elevated to more than 150 during his whole hospital course. D-dimer was moderately increased. Hepatology continued to advocate for azathioprine. Warfarin was held secondary to coagulopathy. He developed a nose bleed for which he was treated with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K with some resolution of symptoms.",

He was simultaneously diagnosed with PSC (Fig. ); therefore, his UC was considered PSC-related. PSC and UC had been well-controlled until the development of severe colitis, diagnosed as toxic megacolon 5 years previously and treated using aminosalicylates, azathioprine, and adalimumab; cholangitis was also present, which was treated with endoscopic biliary stenting. After colitis and cholangitis were treated, the patient had been well, and his liver function remained acceptable. However, his total bilirubin level gradually increased to approximately 5\u20138 mg/dl and colon cancer developed. Surveillance colonoscopy revealed two superficial neoplastic lesions. Slightly elevated lesions were detected in the ascending and transverse colon (Fig. ). Pathological biopsy findings indicated well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the ascending colon and an adenoma in the transverse colon. Because mucosal reddening was observed in the colon (Mayo endoscopic subscore 1\u20132), we diagnosed UC-related colon cancer. Isolated proctocolectomy was initially considered, but the patient\u2019s liver function progressively deteriorated with severe concurrent portal hypertension.

The patient was a non-smoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and denied any illicit drug use. Initial computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a 1.6 x 1.6 cm wide soft tissue density at the hepatic hilum with marked dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts to the level of porta hepatis. Both right and left hepatic ducts, along with common hepatic duct, were stented with metallic stents to relieve jaundice. He also underwent a brush biopsy of common hepatic duct stricture with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which showed atypical cells suggestive of adenocarcinoma. Further cytopathologic investigation with fluorescent in-situ hybridization/digital image analysis confirmed the presence of cholangiocarcinoma. He was then referred to our hospital for liver transplantation for inoperable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.\\nA repeat CT abdomen at our hospital showed intrahepatic biliary obstruction with a suspected 3.1 x 2.0 cm Klatskin tumor. Despite the presence of metallic stents, there was a significant intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with the right biliary stent tip being within the region of the tumor. He underwent endoscopic ultrasound, which did not show any evidence of localized adenopathy. Given the extent of narrowing, the right biliary stent could not be repositioned. As per liver transplant protocol for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, he was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin for eight weeks, followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (67.5 Gray in 15 fractions) and then oral capecitabine.",

Furthermore, she complained about severe pain in her head, chest and right leg. She was intubated, immobilized and transferred by ground emergency to a Level II trauma center nearby.\\nAfter initial trauma management following the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)-scheme, a whole-body CT scan was performed. As direct sequelae of trauma, multiple injuries were found (see Table ), but no traumatic brain injury (ISS = 50 points). Following the damage control concept, the II\u00b0 open tibial fracture was stabilized with an external fixator, followed by surgery of the open mandibular fracture. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after the operation. The postoperative checkup on the ICU 4 h after hospital admission showed an anisocoria (right > left). Therefore, additional diagnostics were initiated. A CT angiography revealed the suspicion of a bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection (Figure ). The suspected diagnosis was confirmed by subsequent extracranial duplex sonography.\\n48 h after the accident, the patient was transferred via helicopter non-intubated to the emergency department of our level I trauma center. It was decided not to intubate the patient prior helicopter transport to make continuous neurological assessment possible. The patient presented with a GCS of 8 under sufentanil analgesia, in soporific condition, not focusing with her eyes, spontaneous movements of the right arm, her left leg moved upon stimulation and the left arm and right leg were not moved spontaneously but after stimulation, no speech production, with persisting anisocoria (right > left) in terms of an incomplete horner syndrome. The additional CT angiography showed no changes in the vascular findings but a cerebral infarction in the left central region.\\nThe patient was transferred to the ICU. A transcranial Doppler sonography showed a sufficient collateral circulation of the middle cerebral artery via the posterior communicating arteries, so that an interventional stent angioplasty (with subsequent need of double platelet aggregation inhibition) was not performed. High-dose intravenous heparinization was started immediately (PTT 60\u201380 s). Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI) on the next day (3 days after trauma) (Figure ) revealed bihemispheric, mainly left-sided, ischemic lesions near the border zone.

Catch-up-ESUS is an open-label, academic, prospective, monocentric, observational registry study that started in January 2018. Clinical data of all consecutive ESUS patients \u226518 years old treated in our hospital who have given written informed consent are collected and observed []. The treatment algorithm in Catch-up-ESUS includes ultrasound examination of the brain vessels, cardiac examination with ECG monitoring for at least 72 hours, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, blood tests, and assessment of AF-related risk markers [].\\nTranscranial contrast-enhanced ultrasound (\u201cbubble test\u201d) showed left-right shunt and transesophageal echocardiography confirmed a relevant PFO with 33 bubbles (Fig. ). A Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score of 6 at this time point suggested an intermediate causality between the PFO and ESUS []. Thus, according to the treatment algorithm within Catch-up-ESUS, the patient was treated with ASA as secondary stroke prevention. In addition, an ICM was implanted. PFO closure was recommended if AF was ruled out during the following 3\u20136 months. In January 2019, the patient was readmitted with acute onset of expressive aphasia and hemiparesis on the right side.",

Cranial CT and CT-angiography revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or ICH, and the large brain vessels were patent. Since anti-factor Xa activity was absent and the INR was <1.7 [], the patient received IVT with rtPA at 0.9 mg/kg (total dose 50 mg) 210 min after stroke onset. Shortly afterwards, the neurological status rapidly improved. On a follow-up blood examination, partial thromboplastin time (52.5 s) and INR (1.33) continued to be slightly elevated, while renal function was still impaired (creatinine clearance 27.8 ml/min). ICH could be ruled out by a follow-up cranial CT. Ultrasound examination of the cerebral vasculature was normal, as was echocardiography. Twenty-four hours after thrombolysis, creatinine clearance had increased above 30.0 ml/min, and treatment with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was initiated.",

CT angiography (CTA) revealed an occlusion of the left MCA (M1 segment) without relevant arteriosclerosis of the carotid arteries. Due to active systemic bleeding with severe melena as a result of his tumor, intravenous thrombolysis was contraindicated. Therefore, we decided to conduct mechanical thrombectomy, which was successful after five thrombectomy maneuvers and intra-arterial administration of 10 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA; , TICI III; symptom-to-recanalization time: 90 min). Clinical symptoms improved remarkably (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS 21 to 3) until the next day. Then, aphasia and hemiparesis worsened and CTA revealed recurrent occlusion of the left MCA (M2 segment). Again, intra-arterial thrombectomy was conducted. One thrombectomy maneuver resulted in recanalization and considerable clinical improvement (TICI III, symptom-to-recanalization time 110 min; NIHSS 11 to 3). Two days later, hemiparesis developed again on the right side and global aphasia also recurred; NIHSS worsened from 2 to 10 points. At this time, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) again detected occlusion of the middle branch of the left MCA in the M2 segment and revealed a relevant diffusion/perfusion mismatch. Once again, thrombectomy was conducted, but the clinical result was less satisfactory (TICI IIb, symptom-to-recanalization time 240 min, NIHSS 10 to 9).

CT angiogram of\\nsupra-aortic vessels confirmed the occlusion of the left internal carotid artery\\n(ICA) excluding hemorrhagic cerebral infarction ().\\nWe decided to perform a complete percutaneous treatment for both the cerebral and\\nmyocardial acute ischemic events. Coronary angiography confirmed a proximal\\nocclusion of the RCA, whereas carotid angiogram showed the occlusion at the origin\\nof the left ICA (). After providing double proximal and distal cerebral protection with\\nboth filter-wire and MOMA system, we first performed thrombus aspiration and then\\nproceeded with stent implantation in the ICA (). A cerebral angiogram,\\nperformed to check the status of intracranial vessels, highlighted clot embolization\\nin the middle cerebral artery () requiring immediate revascularization with 2.0/15 mm\\nballoon angioplasty (). Finally, we completed the revascularization with PCI and bare\\nmetal stent positioning in the RCA, with flow restoration and resolution of ST\\nelevation. Patient's clinical conditions improved significantly in the following\\nhours; however, pharmacological sedation for psychomotor agitation was required for\\n48 h. Dual antiplatelet therapy based on acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg) and\\nclopidogrel (75 mg) was immediately started with loading dose administration.\\nLow-molecular weight heparin was also continued during hospitalization and for the\\nfollowing two weeks. On day 5, functional recovery of the right arm occurred, and on\\nday 7, he achieved complete movement restoration with residual aphasia.",

For 3 days prior, the patient suffered from typical anginal chest pain and New York Heart Association Class II heart failure symptoms. He reported no other symptoms that suggested recent infection or respiratory distress.\\nOn admission, the patient was haemodynamically stable with normal vital signs, including blood pressure 142/93 mmHg, heart rate 77 b.p.m., and temperature 36.5\u00b0C, but tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation on room air was 93%, but lung auscultation did not reveal any crackles, wheezing, or rhonchi. The cardiovascular examination was normal. On neurological examination, the patient did not follow orders correctly, with a Glasgow coma scale score of 14. He presented with left hemiplegia, hypotonia, and left sensory deficit. Capillary glycaemia was 3.2 g/dL, with glycosuria on the urine test strip, but no ketonuria was present.\\nInitial laboratory tests revealed elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels at 661 pg/mL [normal values (NV) 0.00\u201313.00 pg/mL] and inflammatory syndrome with an elevated white blood cell count, with a neutrophil predominance and normal platelet count.

She had a prior history of cardiac valve replacement surgery for both mitral and aortic regurgitations 10 years earlier. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14 and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 5. A CT scan of the head five hours after the onset of symptoms showed a hyperdense basilar artery on two consecutive 5-mm cut images, indicating an acute basilar artery embolism. After obtaining written informed consent for the endovascular therapy from the patient's family, the angiographic procedure began 5.5 hours after the onset of stroke. Angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the distal basilar artery (). At this point, a loading dose of abciximab (0.25 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. Rapid recanalization was achieved using a minimum dose of thrombolytic agents by performing direct angioplasty first followed by intra-arterial thrombolysis. Angioplasty was performed using a 2.5 mm diameter coronary balloon catheter. The balloon catheter was advanced into the occlusion site and inflated to 4 atm for 30 seconds. Immediately after the angioplasty, the basilar artery was partially recanalized with a restoration of the blood flow to the both superior cerebellar arteries. A microcatheter was then placed just proximal to the occlusion site, and 400,000 units of urokinase were infused at a constant rate for one hour. The completion angiograms demonstrated a partial recanalization of the basilar artery with embolus remaining in the basilar tip and the restoration of blood flow to both the posterior and superior cerebellar arteries. In addition, angiograms demonstrated a single perforating thalamic artery that was divided into two branches (). After the endovascular procedure, the patient showed progressive clinical improvement and regained complete consciousness within a few hours.\\nA non-enhanced CT scan obtained immediately after the endovascular therapy showed bilateral symmetrical high attenuations in the paramedian thalamic regions ().

Imaging revealed a distal M1 occlusion with large >100 cc penumbra and small to moderate 15cc core []. The patient had a common origin tortuous arch. She was emergently taken for mechanical thrombectomy. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 19.\\nThe procedure was performed awake with minimal sedation. The right arm was used for access according to our previous description of ultrasound-guided distal transradial artery access in the anatomical snuffbox.[] The patient had a notably slender wrist and small, <2 mm, and distal radial artery. A 5\u201310 cc of 2% lidocaine without epinephrine was used for local anesthesia. A 5-Fr micropuncture kit was used to cannulate the artery, and 100 mcg of nitroglycerin and 5 mg of verapamil were administered intra-arterially. A 7-Fr glide slender sheath was then placed in the snuffbox over an 018 wire []. Given the known common origin, we believed the left common carotid artery could be selected with a glide advantage wire (Terumo) alone through the 6 + Cello (95 cm) balloon guide catheter (Medtronic). The prepped cello was taken up directly over a wire and placed into the high cervical internal carotid artery []. Of note, if the white inserter on the cello is lost a 7F tear away dilator can be used to protect the balloon on insertion. The M1 clot seen on computed tomographic angiography was now in the superior division M2 likely related to tPA administration. A Marksman microcatheter (Medtronic) over a Fathom-16 wire (Boston Scientific) was then navigated into the superior division M3. A micro run was obtained to ensure the catheter was beyond the clot in the correct territory []. A Solitaire 4 mm \u00d7 40 mm device (Medtronic) was deployed from the M2/3 into the M1 segment. The device was left up 5 min for clot integration. Of note, the 6 + Cello has a small 054 lumen, as such with the Marksman within it was very difficult to obtain control runs. The device was pulled slowly under Penumbra pump aspiration with the Cello Balloon inflated for flow arrest and minimal flow reversal. A small red clot was noted on the device, and the Cello cleared through the Penumbra pump aspiration. Final runs demonstrated TICI 3 recanalization within 3 h of symptom onset in a single pass [].

She had a history of hypertension and myocardial infarction with coronary artery stent insertion. She had been taking 100 mg aspirin per day since coronary artery stenting. Her initial vital signs yielded a blood pressure of 107/60 and heart rate of 81 beats per minute.\\nInitial neurologic examination showed eyeball deviation to the right side, left-sided hemiplegia and visual extinction, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 13. Brain computed tomography (CT) angiography showed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Intravenous rTPA infusion was started 3 hours after symptom onset and a subsequent percutaneous cerebral angiogram was performed via right femoral artery access. A 5-Fr Revive IC catheter was introduced into the right internal carotid artery and mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire retriever was attempted on the occluded right MCA, which was successfully recanalized (). Follow-up brain MRI showed acute cerebral infarction in the right MCA territory (). Because there was severe hypokinesia of the left ventricle on transthoracic echocardiography, we planned to use anticoagulation to prevent stroke recurrence.\\nTwo days after the thrombolysis, the patient complained of vague right abdominal pain, and a laboratory test showed anemia. The patient's hemoglobin initially dropped to 9.5 g/dL from 13.1 g/dL. We did not observe oozing from the puncture site, abdominal or posterior pelvic wall hematoma or signs of gastrointestinal bleeding such as melena, hematochezia or hematemesis. We performed contrast-enhanced abdominal CT and found a right renal subcapsular hematoma with mild compression of the renal parenchyma (). We delayed anticoagulation due to the renal hematoma and started anticoagulation 12 days after thrombolysis, after we had confirmed the lack of further hematoma growth on follow-up non-contrast abdominal CT. A follow-up non-contrast abdominal CT scan one month later showed regression of the hematoma. The patient's neurologic symptoms had also improved.",

The patient developed severe pain and swelling in the left foot, local erythema, and ecchymosis a few minutes after the bite. She was taken to a nearby clinic where she was given base treatment, including cleaning the wound and hemostasis. For further treatment, she was subsequently transferred to the hospital. On examination, the vital signs were found to be stable and the left foot was markedly swollen. The neurological examination was essentially normal on admission. She was immediately treated with three 10-mL intravenous injections of polyvalent anti-snake venom serum. Meanwhile, she was also injected with adsorbed tetanus toxoid. She also received ceftriaxone and other supportive therapy. The laboratory findings were as follows: mild leukocytosis and negative coagulation function and fibrin degradation products. The patient developed right-side weakness and speech disturbances on the fourth day after the bite. She also had nonfluent aphasia with difficulty in expression and understanding and right spastic hemiparesis involving the face, arm, and, to a lesser degree, the leg. The examination revealed that edema in the left lower extremity was obvious. The nervous system examination showed that the consciousness was clear. The patient had mixed aphasia. The bilaterally round pupils, about 3 mm in diameter, were sensitive to light reflection. Further, the nasolabial fold was shallow on the right, the tongue deviated to the right, and the right limb muscle strength was 0.

She looked dehydrated and her skin was diffusely hyperpigmented with hypertrichosis.\\nShe denied any major problem in her past clinical history. The recent clinical history was also uneventful, except for an episode of gastroenteritis, about 10 days previously, after which she slowly improved for a few days, followed by the progressive development of the presenting complaints. Renal ultrasounds, performed in the emergency room, revealed kidneys of normal size, without signs of obstruction. Chest X-ray was normal. The patient was oligoanuric; she reported decreasing urinary output in the last few days and catheterization yielded <50 mL of urine. The EKG is shown in .\\nNo previous blood test was available and the patient recalled having performed the last ones a few years before, when, on the occassion of the death of her father, she had undergone a general evaluation for having lost \u2018considerable weight\u2019.\\nThe first blood tests performed in the emergency room revealed: serum creatinine, 5.55 mg/dL, active inflammatory signs [C-reactive protein, 41.2 mg/dL (normal < 0.8 mg/dL); fibrinogen, 938 mg/dL], massive leukocytosis (WBC, 67 000), suggestive of both severe haemoconcentration and infection, with severe sodium and potassium imbalance (Na, 107 mmol/L; K, 1.61 mmol/L), moderate, compensated metabolic acidosis (pH, 7.34; HCO3, 19.4 mmol/L; base excess, \u22124 mmol/L) and moderate hyperglycaemia (160 mg/dL). Haemoglobin level (15 g/dL) was normal. Elevated levels of creatinine\u2013phosphokinase (26 186 UI/L) indicated concomitant rhabdomyolysis, probably as a result of infection and severe electrolyte imbalance, potentially contributing to the acute renal failure.\\nIn the face of the complex metabolic disorder, a hierarchy of interventions was defined, starting from potassium supplementation with very slow sodium infusion, aimed at raising the sodium level by no more than 10\u201312 mEq/day. As it will be further discussed, the working diagnostic hypotheses are of an acute renal failure superimposed on a chronic kidney disease in the context of diuretic abuse. In spite of the need for rapid correction of the potassium and sodium levels, each of the interventions has, however, important limits and drawbacks and the anuric status limits the use of the most widely employed formulae guiding assessment and therapy in severe sodium imbalance ()\\nAbout 12 h after admission, in the absence of cognitive deficits, she suddenly developed flaccid tetraplegia and restrictive respiratory failure. A prompt transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required because of respiratory failure. She was sedated and mechanical ventilation was started.\\nAt transfer to the ICU and immediately after intubation (pO2, 193 mmHg; pCO2, 35.4 mmHg), the major electrolyte levels were the following: Na, 114 mmol/L; K, 0.8 mmol/L; HCO3, 15 mmol/L; lactate, 0.8 mmol/L; chloride, 83 mmol/L; ionized calcium, 1.16 mmol/L; pH, 7.255; base excess, \u221212 mmol/L; anion gap, 17 mmol/L.",

At 6 days before presentation, patient had symptoms of severe cough with streaks of blood and dyspnea on exertion and was treated with azithromycin antibiotic for presumed upper respiratory tract infection. The day before presentation, patient's symptoms of cough and dyspnea started getting worse. Patient reported taking benzonatate antitussive, which caused tingling and numbness around his mouth and cheeks, which resolved spontaneously after 30 min. Patient did not report of hives, swelling of the face or tongue and difficulty in swallowing. Subsequently, patient got extremely agitated and short of breath leading to state of unconsciousness. Emergency medical services were activated, 100% oxygen was initiated and patient was transferred to our ER.\\nIn the ER, patient presented with grey colored skin and symptoms of severe dyspnea. As per the patient's wife, he had no calf pain and/or swelling recently. There were no recent hospitalizations, prolonged immobilization or history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombus (DVT). He had no other medical procedures and/or surgeries performed in the recent past. Patient's father has a history of PE secondary to extensive airplane travel and stroke. Patient has no history of familial clotting disorders. Consequently, patient developed complete heart block and received intravenous atropine and epinephrine. An electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads with elevated troponins of 13.5 ng/ml (normal <0.03 ng/ml). Cardiac monitor showed pulseless electric activity and patient was intubated and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated immediately. The cardiac arrest was presumed from ST elevation myocardial infarction and the patient was transferred to cardiac catheterization laboratory. Patient intermittently remained in cardiac arrest requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and temporary pacemaker. Short episodes of CPR were performed. Cardiac catheterization showed non-obstructive coronary arteries and a hyper-dynamic left ventricle. Patient's blood pressure remained low and so patient was continued on epinephrine, dopamine drips. Patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit and he remained intubated with mechanical ventilation and ongoing CPR. On physical examination, the patient was noted to have respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, fixed and dilated pupils of 7 mm and endotracheal tube in place. His neck was supple without jugular vein distention. Chest examination revealed distant lung sounds, with no wheezing. Cardiac auscultation was tachycardia with no murmurs, gallops and rubs.

The pain had been intermittent and was occurring spontaneously, every two to three weeks, for the last year. Her current episode spanned over 15 days and had gradually been increasing in intensity. The pain radiated to the back and was associated with three episodes of non-projectile, non-bilious vomiting. The pain had no association with meals. The review of systems revealed undocumented weight loss and reduced appetite. She had a history of Grade 3 ductal carcinoma of the left breast, treated with mastectomy and chemoradiotherapy 10 years previously. She had also undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 15 years ago. Family history was not significant for any illness. At the time of presentation, she was being treated for Helicobacter pylori gastritis with triple therapy. There was no history of smoking, drug, or alcohol use.\\nAt the time of presentation to the emergency room (ER), the patient was in severe pain. The patient was of short stature and lean, and was visibly distressed. At the time of presentation to the ER, she was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 64 to 81 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 30-40 mm Hg and tachycardic (Pulse = 131-150 bpm). She was afebrile. General physical examination revealed pallor and dehydration of conjunctival and oral mucosae. On abdominal examination, there was generalized tenderness but no guarding. Gut sounds were audible. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Resuscitation with intravenous fluids was initiated. A central venous catheter was placed to monitor fluid status and for the administration of norepinephrine. Tramadol was given to manage the pain and heparin sodium subcutaneously for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.\\nLaboratory investigations revealed anemia (hemoglobin 8.9 gm/dl) and renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.2 mg/dl).

        "note": "A 74-year-old man presented to our hospital with abdominal pain and bloating since December 2013. He had undergone craniotomy for a brain tumor approximately 30 years ago. He had no history of alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking, and his family history was not significant. Since 2001, he had been managed regularly for type C liver cirrhosis. He did not have a treatment history of interferon use. He had undergone sclerotherapy for esophageal varices in 2001 and hepatic arterial chemoembolization in 2004, and did not have any recurrences. However, he continued to receive oral furosemide (20 mg) and spironolactone (50 mg) daily for ascites retention. Although he maintained a body weight of 60 kg and an abdominal circumference of 85 cm, his body weight and abdominal circumference rapidly increased to 70 kg and 100 cm, respectively. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of increased ascites; thus, the dose of furosemide was increased to 30 mg/day, and puncture was repeated for ascites removal. Since there was no improvement, he was hospitalized in January 2014.\\nOn admission, the following physical findings were noted: height, 168 cm; body weight, 69 kg; abdominal circumference, 100 cm; consciousness, lucid; body temperature, 35.5 \u00b0C; blood pressure, 137/85 mmHg; pulse, 80 beats/min (regular). The palpebral conjunctiva showed no sign of anemia. The bulbar conjunctiva had no yellow staining. The chest findings were normal with no evidence of heart murmur or spider angioma. The abdomen was swollen, severely distended, and wave-palpable. He had spontaneous abdominal pain without tenderness and had no edema in the extremities.\\nHis blood test findings are shown in Table . The Child\u2013Pugh score was 9 points (B) with moderate or greater ascites volume and no encephalopathy. His platelet count was low. No renal impairment was observed.\\nOn plain abdominal computed tomography (Fig. ), both the hepatic lobes were atrophic with a blunt margin and irregularity on the surface. A moderate volume of ascites retention was observed.\\nThe ascites fluid obtained following puncture indicated the presence of transudative ascites, which was macroscopically pale yellow and transparent with a cell count of 200/\u00b5L and a protein level of 2.0 g/dL. The cytological diagnosis was class I, and the culture test was negative.\\nThe patient\u2019s clinical course is presented in Fig. . The patient was on salt restriction (\u22645 g/day) and water restriction (\u22641 L/day), and he underwent three courses of cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART). However, he again exhibited ascites retention after several days, and the urinary volume was insufficient at 1,000\u20131,500 mL/day. On day 10, oral tolvaptan (3.75 mg/day) was started, and his urinary volume immediately increased to 2,000 mL/day. Adverse reactions, such as hypernatremia and liver dysfunction, were not observed. Since the patient still required puncture for ascites removal, the dose of tolvaptan was increased to 7.5 mg/day on day 17. His urinary volume increased to approximately 2,500 mL/day, and his body weight and abdominal circumference improved gradually without any puncture for ascites removal. His abdominal pain and bloating improved, and he was discharged on day 22.\\nHe continued tolvaptan (7.5 mg/day) treatment, and at approximately day 60, the patient realized that his urinary volume had decreased. He presented with abdominal bloating and weight gain again. Re-exacerbation of the ascites was suspected, and the patient was readmitted on day 72 (Fig. ). A sufficient urinary volume was not observed after admission. We presumed that urine osmolality decreased due to the continuous administration of furosemide, which may have hampered the diuretic effect of tolvaptan in the renal collecting tubule; furosemide was discontinued on day 78. Subsequently, his urinary volume temporarily increased to more than 4,000 mL/day. There is a possibility that the albumin infusions (days 78\u201380) affected the temporary increase in his urinary volume; however, a volume of \u22652,000 mL/day was maintained over the next month after discontinuing furosemide.",

The subsequent ABG showed persistent uncompensated lactic acidosis with the appearance of alveolar hypoventilation, (pH 7.22, pCO2 5.25 kPa, bicarbonate 16.6 mmol/l and lactate 5.7 mmol/l). The patient fell into a coma and was quickly transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where he was immediately intubated using rapid sequence induction (etomidate, succinylcholine and fentanyl). For the next 3 h, the patient was not sedated but remained in a profound coma, being unarousable (GCS 3/15) and showing insufficient spontaneous respiration needing controlled ventilation. He presented periodic myoclonic movements of both lower limbs with no abnormal movement of the upper body without improvement after 1 mg of IV clonazepam. Seven hours post-injection the patient recovered spontaneous ventilation and woke up progressively. Ten hours post-injection, the patient was alert and answered simple questions by shaking his head, but his pupils were still mydriatic and poorly responsive to light. We noted a right lateral gaze palsy and flaccid tetraparesia 2/5 with hypoactive deep tendon reflexes, thus preventing extubation. A brain CT excluded any cerebral lesion. Eleven hours post-injection the patient showed complete recovery of motor response and normalisation of deep tendon reflexes allowing extubation.\\nHis mean arterial blood pressure stayed in the normal range without vasopressive agents. We observed a sinus tachycardia (110\u2013130 bpm) and short runs of atrial tachycardia. No ventricular arrhythmias were noted during monitoring. The troponins peaked at 1450 ng/l 24 h post-injection. We concluded a type II myocardial infarction due to sympathetic overstimulation. Daily aspirin was introduced and an ambulatory cardiac assessment was organised.\\nWe noted polyuria up to 400 ml/h with a normal urine analysis.",

        "note": "A 78-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension, dementia, and prior transient ischemic attack was brought into the hospital by his daughter for altered sensorium and gait disturbance. At baseline, the patient was capable of ambulating without assistance. He was last known well around 23:00 one day prior to his emergency visit. According to the daughter, around 11:00 on the day of his admission, the patient was noted to have difficulty in standing and sitting upright unassisted. His speech was garbled and nearly unintelligible. Earlier, he reported to his daughter that he \u201cfelt drunk\u201d and was unable to focus on her face. Subsequently, the daughter brought the patient to the emergency room five hours later at around 16:00.\\nOn presentation, the patient was afebrile, normotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic. Pulse oximetry showed a hemoglobin saturation of 98% on room air. Physical exam findings were normal except for lethargy, disorientation, and response to deep pain by moving all extremities. His blood profile showed an acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.24 mg/dL, up from a baseline of 1.0 mg/dL (equivalent to drop in glomerular filtration rate from 95 to 68 mL/min/1.73 m2), and an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.090, PaCO2 of 10.0 mmHg, serum bicarbonate of 8 mMol/L, and an anion gap of 29 mMol/L. Lactic acid was 1.6 mMol/L on a venous sample sent to the laboratory; however, a point-of-care arterial blood gas revealed a lactic acid of 27.0 mMol/L ().\\nThe venous lactic acid level was initially attributed to a laboratory error given the consistently profound low pH on repeated arterial blood gases. A thorough investigation into the cause of this perceived severe lactic acidosis was undertaken and no clear etiology was identified. There was no evidence of sepsis or postictal symptoms, head CT was negative for stroke, and glucose and beta hydroxybutyrate were within normal limits. Furthermore, there were no signs of gangrenous tissue and surgical and radiological evaluations were negative for ischemic bowel or incarcerated hernia. Additionally, the patient was hemodynamically stable with normal liver enzymes, making systemic hypoperfusion or decreased clearance of lactic acid highly unlikely.\\nDespite several fluid boluses and sodium bicarbonate administration, the acidosis and lactate levels did not improve. Further investigation revealed an undetectable methanol level, and a serum ethylene glycol level of 54 mg/dL.",

        "note": "Our patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of disordered eating requiring enteral feeds to supplement oral intake, in the context of gastrointestinal dysfunction of unknown cause, severe rectal prolapse requiring surgery and colostomy, and recurrent bowel obstructions. The patient was admitted in January 2018 severely cachectic requiring TPN (with Smoflipid). Initially, this was well tolerated. On Day 29, to allow for time off TPN, her TPN was increased from 90 to 110 mL/h. One hour after the TPN infusion was initiated, she developed urticaria on the neck, arms, and chest. TPN/Smoflipid were immediately held and diphenhydramine was given, with rapid improvement of pruritis and resolution of the urticaria within 3 days. She was put on lower rate TPN, which she tolerated until discharge (see Additional file ). Skin testing for standard TPN, lipids, egg, and soy were negative. It was hypothesized that she may have reacted to niacin in the TPN, or that she had an atypical IgE hypersensitivity reaction to an unidentified allergen with late manifestations, due to daily TPN masking initial sensitization.\\nIn May 2018, she was admitted for re-testing of TPN, with the collaboration of General Internal Medicine, Total Parental Nutrition and Allergy. She was initially started at a 1:10 dilution of standard TPN, and she did not develop reactions. The next day, her prescription was increased to undiluted standard TPN, and she developed mild urticaria on her right arm. On Day 3, lipids were started. Within 50 min, she developed erythema on her tongue, neck and face. She was given 25 mg of diphenhydramine, which improved her symptoms. The following day, she discharged herself against medical advice (see Additional file ).\\nShe was admitted again in September 2018 for severe malnutrition (Body Mass Index 11.2). Due to risk of re-feeding syndrome, initial TPN (375 kcal and 40 g a.a.) consisted of 200 mL of 20% amino acids, 100 mL of 70% dextrose, and 500 mL of water, and standard electrolytes, trace metals and vitamins, at a continuous rate of 33 mL/h. This was supplemented by oral food and Vivonex PEJ feeds. By Day 6, her TPN had been progressively advanced to 400 mL of 20% amino acids, 400 mL of 70% dextrose, standard additives, at a continuous rate of 33 mL/h. There were no reactions during this period. She tolerated her TPN well until Day 21, and the rest of her treatment proceeded as follows (see Additional file ):Day 21: She was prescribed 20% Smoflipid at 5 mL/h for 6 h and cetirizine 5 mg 3 h before lipids. 2 h after starting the infusion, the TPN was temporarily infused at 100 mL/h before being lowered to the prescribed rate of 33 mL/h. 1 h afterwards, she reported itchiness, hives and erythema on both hands (see Fig. ). Smoflipid was held. She was given one dose of diphenhydramine 25 mg. Overnight, she had abdominal pain and high volume stoma output. Day 26: Her TPN rate was increased from 33 mL/h (over 24 h) to 37 mL/h (over 19 h), to provide a break off TPN. Day 27: While receiving TPN, she developed a pruritic rash extending to both arms, the neck, and pelvis, relieved by cetirizine. Day 28: It was decided to replace Smoflipid with Intralipid at 5 mL/h for 5 h, with pretreatment of 10 mg cetirizine. Day 29: She reported an erythematous, warm, pruritic rash on both arms. Lipids were held. Cetirizine 10 mg was given, relieving the rash. Day 33: A retrial 25 mL of 20% Intralipid at 5 mL/h was given with cetirizine premedication. She developed pruritis, but no urticaria. Day 34: Following a literature review, the allergist recommended a trial of lower osmolality TPN. TPN was re-prescribed with 400 mL of 20% amino acids, 400 mL of 70% dextrose, 400 mL of water, and standard additive doses, infused at a cyclical rate of 65 mL/h for 17 h, with 20% Intralipid infused at 2 mL/h over 5 h.",

He complained of recurrent similar episodes for the last 2 years, which resolved on oral antibiotics. There was no history of fever, hematuria, or abdominal pain. Urine examination showed the presence of pus cells with positive culture for Escherichia coli, suggestive of UTI. An ultrasound of the kidneys revealed bilateral mild hydronephrosis (right kidney 8.3 \u00d7 3.2 cm, left kidney 9 \u00d7 4.8 cm) with bladder wall thickened 8.8mm and post-void residue 42 cc. The patient received oral ciprofloxacin as per culture sensitivity to which he responded. Review of records revealed that the child was diagnosed with craniopharyngioma at 10 years of age when he presented with headache and visual loss. He underwent frontotemporal craniectomy with orbitozygomatic osteotomy and tumor decompression. There were no endocrinal disorders in the preoperative period. A repeat left retromastoid craniotomy with tumor debulking was done after 1 year due to tumor recurrence, followed by 35 cycles of radiotherapy. The patient remained free of any neurological or systemic complaints till 16 years of age when he developed recurrent UTI and received multiple courses of oral antibiotics elsewhere. History on review confirmed the presence of polyuria and nocturnal enuresis in between the UTI episodes, which were the initial clues to CDI but were missed. The patient also reported increased lethargy and somnolence during the daytime, and hence had stopped attending school for the past 3 years.\\nAt 18 years of age, his weight was 56kg (\u22120.49 standard deviation score (SDS)), height was 160.5 cm (\u22121.69 SDS), body mass index (BMI) was 21.74kg/m2 (+0.22 SDS), and bilateral testicular volume was 2mL with absent pubic hair, and he was normotensive.

        "note": "A 39-year-old woman in her 3rd pregnancy booked with us at 12 weeks of gestational age. Her previous pregnancies had culminated in normal vaginal deliveries. She is a housewife with a moderately active lifestyle. Aside from a history of on and off constipation, her past medical history was unremarkable and her current pregnancy was managed as a low-risk pregnancy. All her booking visit investigations including thyroid status were normal. She was on calcium supplements throughout the pregnancy and iron supplementation in second and third trimesters. Her booking BMI was 28 and total weight gain was 9 kg.\\nAt 39 weeks of gestation, she went into labour spontaneously. Following approximately 4 h of the latent period, she had a spontaneous rupture of membranes. On admission to the labour ward, her cervical dilatation was 4 cm and well effaced with one mild contraction per 10 min. No rectal enema was given on admission to labour ward. Second review after 4 h revealed the similar vaginal examination findings while she was experiencing only 2 moderate contractions per 10 min. After careful evaluation, oxytocin infusion (5 mIU/ml) was commenced and maintained to achieve 3\u20134 contractions per 10 min. She opted to have nitrous oxide and intramuscular pethidine as pain relief and had liberal oral fluids during active first stage of labour. Active phase of the first stage lasted 5 h in total, after which active pushing in the second stage was attempted for nearly 45 min. At this stage, a moderate caput had developed with grade 2 moulding and the diagnosis of deep transverse arrest was made. The attempt at manually rotating the fetal head in the labour room failed. Since the patient declined a trial of instrumental delivery, an emergency cesarean section was performed. During the cesarean section, the uterine incision was noted to have a right sided extension towards the vagina which was sutured carefully. No bladder damage was noted. Total blood loss was approximated at 400 ml, and her baby weighed 2.9 kg. She was commenced on oral fluids 2 h postoperatively and mobilized after 6 h from surgery. Standard post-operative bladder care, catheter care and fluid management were given. Urinary catheter was removed on post-operative day 1 and the patient was discharged on the second post-operative day after spontaneous bowel opening with paracetamol and NSAIDs for analgesia, oral antibiotics for 5 days with prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin for 7 days and iron supplements for 6 months.\\nOne week later she had presented to the general practitioner with a history of no bowel movements for 6 consecutive days and anuria for the last 3 days. She was prescribed stool softeners and a rectal enema and was directed to the emergency department by the general practitioner. However, patient did not present to the emergency department initially as she had a bowel movement. Over the next day she complained of severe abdominal discomfort and progressive abdominal distention with difficulty in breathing and persistent anuria prompting her to ultimately present to emergency treatment unit.\\nOn admission she was hemodynamically stable, and her abdomen was distended with evidence of free fluid. As she had undergone a second stage cesarean section, the team decided to catheterize and rule out the possibility of a bladder injury causing urine leakage into the peritoneal cavity. Catheter drained 1 l of clear urine and subsequent ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis showed normal bladder contour, normal ureters and moderate amount of peritoneal free fluid. Her renal function tests showed evidence of acute kidney injury, which were as follows:\\neGFR \u2212 16.67 ml/min/1.73m2.\\nBlood Urea \u2212 150.5 mg/dl.\\nSerum creatinine \u2212 3.32 mg/dl.\\nDigital rectal examination revealed significant fecal loading and manual dis-impaction was done; followed by rectal enema. Subsequently she was commenced on oral laxatives. Upon further evaluation of the patient\u2019s history, it was revealed that she had constipation throughout the latter part of her pregnancy which she had failed to mention in previous appointments with her caregivers.\\nOver the next 12 h the patient produced 12 l of urine. Her laboratory investigations revealed hyponatremia with serum sodium level of 123 mmol/l (reference range \u2013 136- 145 mmol/l). Patient\u2019s urine protein level was 8.1 mg/dl (reference range \u2013 0 \u2013 15.0 mg/dl) and urine protein: creatinine ratio was 0.38 (reference range- less than 0.2).",

        "note": "The patient was a 67-year-old Japanese male. At the age of 64, the patient had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy and choledochojejunostomy to treat extrahepatic bile duct cancer. At that time, the extrahepatic bile duct cancer was rated as pT4N1M0, pStage IVA, according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 7th edition. The patient also had underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus disease, for which he had been prescribed therapeutic diet modification and habitual exercise. Tests for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus markers were negative. There was no family history of endocrine disease (including diabetes mellitus), autoimmune disease, liver disease, or malignancy. The patient was a habitual alcohol drinker, but daily alcohol consumption amount was less than 30 g. During management at a preceding medical facility, he had undergone S4/8 subsegmental hepatectomy to treat HCC, with resection of a single confluent multinodular type of tumor (measuring 55 mm in maximum diameter) that was histopathologically rated as pT2N0M0, pStage II, according to the UICC 7th edition. Six months after the operation, the patient was detected to have developed intrahepatic recurrence and was treated by 6 sessions of drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE) at the same previous facility. No systemic therapy (including adjuvant chemotherapy) was administered. Forty-one months after the subsegmental hepatectomy, the patient visited our hospital, wishing to continue treatment for recurrent HCC. The first CECT performed at our hospital revealed that the recurrent tumor was confined to the liver (three lesions, 37 mm in maximum diameter), without any evidence of major vessel involvement or distant metastasis, which was within up-to-seven criteria []. Therefore, the patient received DEB-TACE with cisplatin, conventional TACE (cTACE) with miriplatin, and cTACE treatment with epirubicin (one session of each), but all proved ineffective. Since no disease control of the recurrent HCC was achieved even after nine sessions of TACE, we judged that the patient had TACE-refractory HCC [].\\nWe selected systemic therapy as the following line of treatment and registered the patient into the GO30140 study []. At the time of registration, the patient was classified as Child\u2013Pugh class A and modified albumin\u2013bilirubin (ALBI) Grade 1, his ECOG-PS was 0, and blood tests revealed elevation of the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (50U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (59U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (518U/L) levels. We considered TACE as the major cause of the liver injury detected in the patient. However, as the body mass index was high (30.2) and the patient had underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus, we considered that he might also suffer from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) []. The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) levels were both within normal range, while the serum HbA1c value was slightly elevated (6.9%). shows the blood test data at the start of treatment within the framework of the study that the patient was enrolled in. CECT performed at the start of treatment revealed intrahepatic recurrence in S1, S2, and S8, without any major vessel involvement, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis. Fifty-five months after the earlier subsegmentectomy, the patient was started on atezolizumab\u2013bevacizumab combination therapy (atezolizumab 1200 mg/body, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, once every 3 weeks). The patient developed no adverse events including fever in the first 4 weeks following treatment. A CECT repeated at 15 weeks after the start of the therapy revealed no lesion in S1 or S2, a decrease in the diameter of the lesion in S8, and there were no hypervascular enhanced lesions within the liver in the arterial phase. We judged that the patient achieved partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and complete response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). graphically represents the changes over time in the imaging findings of the lesions in S8 and S1 (a\u2013c: CECT before the start of treatment, d,e: CT at 25 weeks after the start of treatment, f: CT scan at 28 weeks).\\nillustrates the time course of the hepatobiliary enzyme levels and clinical course of the patient after the start of atezolizumab\u2013bevacizumab combination therapy.

At 21 weeks after the start of the therapy, the patient complained of poor appetite and malaise. The blood test revealed hyperglycemia (569 mg/dL), elevation of the serum level of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (658 \u03bcmol/L), and slight elevation of the serum HbA1c level to 8.9%.",

Laboratory examinations showed: serum creatinine 290 mmol/L (corresponding to an estimated GFR of 19 mL/min per 1.73 mq), urea 47 mmol/L, sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 3.69 mmol/L, serum albumin 30 g/L, cholesterol 3.93 mmol/L and triglycerides 2.19 mmol/L.\\nUrinalysis showed microhematuria, while quantitative proteinuria was 2.26 g/24 h. Autoimmunity evaluation, which included ANA, ENA, ANCA, C3 and C4, resulted negative.\\nSo, in order to better elucidate the causes of renal disorder, we performed a percutaneous renal biopsy. Histological examination showed glomeruli with mesangial expansion and endocapillary hypercellularity due mostly by neutrophils infiltration with some karyorrhectic bodies, fibrinoid necrosis of small arterioles, and fibrocellular crescents (Figure ). There was also moderate tubular atrophy within massive protein droplets, and moderate interstitial fibrosis. Immunofluorescence analysis did not show immune deposits, while electronic microscopy was not performed. So, considering clinical and histological findings our final diagnosis was rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis secondary to ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.\\nAt the time of biopsy pharmacological treatments included intravenous diuretics (furosemide 125 mg/d), antihypertensive drugs and SSRI. After the renal biopsy, also in consideration of the further deterioration of renal function (serum creatinine till 343 mmol/L), intravenous methylprednisolone was administered at the dose of 500 mg for three days followed by oral steroid at the initial dose of 1 mg/kg per day. In addition, the induction therapy was completed with a single dose of 500 mg of intravenous CYC (8 mg/kg). To minimize the risk of haemorrhagic cystitis, saline solution was infused 2 h before the cyclophosphamide administration. In the following days, while renal function gradually improved, patient clinical conditions worsened with development of confusion and headache. Laboratory examinations showed serum sodium 122 mmol/L, urinary osmolality 199 mOsm/kg, and serum creatinine 202 mmol/L.",

He denied vomiting, diarrhea, pain, dyspnea, cough, and fever.\\nHe was referred about 4.5 years earlier after having total thyroidectomy that showed multifocal MTC with cervical lymph nodes metastasis. His past medical and surgical history was otherwise unremarkable. He had no family history of MTC, other tumors, or consanguinity, and negative screening for pheochromocytoma, hyerparathyroidism, and germline RET (rearranged during transfection) oncogene mutation. Calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were >5850 pmol/L (normal, <5.5) and 506 \u03bcg/L (normal, <4.3), respectively. Over the following year, he underwent bilateral neck dissection for extensive regional lymph node metastasis followed by external radiation. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed normal liver and bilateral pulmonary metastases. Calcitonin and CEA decreased to 1430 pmol/L and 287 \u03bcg/L and then increased to 5290 pmol/L and 544 \u03bcg/L, respectively, 4 months prior to admission. One year before admission, random glucose was 5.22 mmol/L.\\nOn admission (day one), he was afebrile and appeared severely dehydrated. Pulse was 125/min, blood pressure 145/90 mmHg (previous readings, 100\u2013110/65\u201375), and body mass index 20.9 kg/m2. He had multiple facial erythematous papules and few pustules but no moon face, centripetal obesity, supraclavicular fullness, cervical fat pad, striae, easy bruising, or stigmata of chronic liver disease except for non-tender hepatomegaly. He had normal muscle power and deep tendon reflexes. White blood cell (WBC) count was 21.7\u00d7109/L (80 % neutrophils), creatinine 52 \u03bcmol/L (normal, <115), potassium 2.1 mmol/L (normal, 3.5\u20135.0), sodium 148 mmol/L (normal, 135\u2013147), CO2 27 mmol/L (normal, 22\u201331), glucose 25.7 mmol/L, albumin 35 g/L (normal, 32\u201348), total bilirubin 12 \u03bcmol/L (normal, <21), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) 199 U/L (normal, 10\u201345), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 117 U/L (normal, 10\u201345), alkaline phosphatase 216 U/L (normal, 40\u2013135), venous blood pH 7.49 (normal, 7.30\u20137.40), CEA 3643 \u03bcg/L, calcitonin 1800 pmol/L, and glycated hemoglobin 0.07 (normal, <0.065). Insulin, intravenous fluid and potassium replacement, enoxaparin 40 mg/d, and topical acne treatment were started, and levothyroxine 150 \u03bcg, vitamin D3 2000 unit, and calcium carbonate 1200 mg daily were continued.\\nUrine output was consistently >8 L/d, while plasma and urine osmolality were 296/310 (normal, 275\u2013300) and 189/190 mOsm/kg, respectively; and sodium, potassium, glucose, and urea 154/148, 2.9/2.8, 21.5/14.5, and 2.6/2.3 (normal, 4.2\u20134.2) mmol/L, respectively. Intranasal desmopressin (DDAVP) 40 \u03bcg/d reduced urine output to 4.85 L/d (sodium, potassium, and glucose were 149, 3.5, and 12.1 mmol/L, respectively).\\nOn day 5, cortisol and ACTH were 3782 nmol/L (normal, 171\u2013536) and 872 ng/L (normal, 5\u201360; to convert to pmol/L multiply by 0.22), respectively, urinary free cortisol 129,204 nmo (normal, 100\u2013379), dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate (DHEAS) 50.8 \u03bcmol/L (normal, 4.42\u201311.50), dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA) 12 ng/mL (Mayo Medical Laboratories (MML), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; normal, <13; to convert to nmol/L multiply by 3.47), androstendione >35 nmol/L (normal, 2.4-12.6), renin 19.6 mU/L (normal, 4.4\u201346.1), and aldosterone < 8 ng/dL (MML; normal, < 21; to convert to nmol/L multiply by 0.277). 8-mg dexamethasone suppression test showed a paradoxical increase in cortisol to 4279 nmol/L. Urinary potassium was >100 mmol/d with plasma potassium of 3.3 mmol/L.\\nCT scan showed 1.8 cm pretracheal lymph node, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, 1.4 cm left paracardiac lymph node, progression of lung metastases bilaterally (largest 3 cm), new liver metastases (largest 5x5 cm with central necrosis and hemorrhage), enlarged adrenal glands (Fig. ), and short segment of dissection in abdominal aorta with thrombosed false lumen (Fig. ). Aortic dissection was managed conservatively by enoxaparin and blood pressure control. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan showed multiple hypermetabolic liver and lung lesions and diffuse bilateral hypermetabolic adrenal activity (Fig. ). Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal (Fig. ).\\nEscalating doses of insulin (up to 87 U/d), spironolactone (up to 450 mg/d), oral and intravenous potassium (up to 340 mmol/d), amlodipine (up 10 mg/d), and carvedilol (up to 25 mg/d) were required to control CS (Fig. &). Adrenalectomy was not offered because of aortic dissection/thrombosis necessitating anticoagulation. Ketoconazole and mitotane were not used because of liver dysfunction, and metyrapone because of severe hypokalemia. Sorafinib 400 mg twice daily was started on day 10 (vandetanib and cabozantinib were unavailable). DDAVP was stopped because it may stimulate ectopic ACTH secretion; four days later, urine output increased to 7.8 L/d with ADH of 3.3 pg/mL (MML; normal, 0.0-6.9; to convert to pmol/L multiply by 0.926), plasma and urine osmolality of 311 and 522 mOsm/kg, respectively, and sodium, potassium, and glucose of 149, 3.5, and 14.8 mmol/L, respectively.\\nOn day 15, he developed dyspnea, cough, mild hemoptysis, and oxygen desaturation without fever. Echocardiography was normal. CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and new diffuse bronchial-wall thickening and multiple patchy ground-glass opacities. WBC was 13.6\u00d7109 (94 % neutrophils). Sputum culture was positive for streptococcus pneumonia. Procalcitonin concentration was 110 ng/mL (normal, <0.5; severe bacterial infection, >2.0). He was treated vancomycin followed by ceftriaxone (till day 42). 99mTc-Octreotide scan revealed that the liver and lung lesions were not octreotide avid.\\nOn day 20, because of no measurable changes in ACTH and cortisol concentrations and development of proximal lower limb weakness (could get up from chair unassisted with difficulty), mifepristone 300 mg/d was started. At that time, blood pressure was 141/89 mmHg and sodium, potassium, and glucose 151, 3.6, and 7.8 mmol/L, respectively.\\nOn day 25, CEA concentration decreased to 3019 \u03bcg/L, calcitonin to 1530 pmol/l (Fig. ), DHEAS to 23.96 \u03bcmol/L (Fig. ), and DHEA to 3.9 ng/ml (Fig. ). Further, blood pressure normalized to 118/78 mmHg and sodium, potassium, and glucose to 145, 4.3, and 7.5 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. &). However, cortisol and ACTH did not decrease (3911 nmol/L, 1664 ng/L, respectively) (Fig. ), and androstenedione continued to be >35 nmol/L. Renin was 22.1 mU/L.\\nOn day 27, he complained of intermittent colicky abdominal pain increasing in severity and frequency, loss of appetite, and generalized fatigability in association with low normal blood pressure and glucose despite reducing insulin and amlodipine doses. Procalcitonin concentration was 281 ng/ml. Adrenal insufficiency was suspected, mifepristone discontinued, and intravenous dexamethasone given for 5 days (initially 8 mg/d) without remarkable improvement. The abdominal pain was treated with fentanyl patch supplemented with intravenous morphine. CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusion, reduction in the left paracardiac lymph node to 1 cm with central necrosis, mild reduction in the size of liver metastases, ascites, patent portal vein, no evidence of biliary dilatation, no change in the appearance of aortic dissection or adrenal glands, and jejuno-jejunal intussusception (Fig. ) with fecal loading without evidence of bowel obstruction.\\nOn day 34, proximal lower limb weakness progressed to the degree that he was bed-bound, despite remarkable control of CS manifestations (Fig. -), and was associated with loss of deep tendon reflexes. There was no muscle pain, tenderness, atrophy, or post-exercise facilitation. Electrolytes were normal. The unexplained weakness together with the development of difficulty in swallowing due to reduced salivation (requiring saliva substitute every four hours, modified barium swallow evaluation was normal), difficulty in urination, constipation, and rather unexplained postural tachycardia prompted investigations for neurological autoimmunity. A paraneoplastic autoantibody screen revealed elevated neuronal ganglionic acetylcholine (alpha-3) autoantibodies of 0.12 nmol/L and borderline P/Q type calcium channel autoantibodies of 0.02 nmol/L (MML; normal, <0.02), consistent with autoimmune dysautonomia. Nerve conduction and repetitive nerve stimulation studies were unremarkable (23 % amplitude increment with 30 stimuli/s). Electromyography of the right anterior tibial and vastus medialis muscles showed reduction in mean amplitude (0.13 and 0.15 mV, normal 0.22 and 0.23 mV, respectively) and duration (8.5 and 8.8 ms, normal 13.1 and 10.9 ms, respectively). 25 Hydroxyvitamin D was 15 nmol/L, free T4 6.4 pmol/L (normal, 12\u201322), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 1.27 mU/L (normal, 0.27\u20134.20), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 20.5 ng/L (normal, 15\u201365; to convert to pmol/L multiply by 0.1061).\\nDespite persistently elevated ACTH and cortisol, starting on day 20, insulin and potassium doses had to be tapered off to avoid hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia (Fig. &). Further, mifepristone which was restarted on day 34 at 200 mg/d had to be decreased to 100 mg/d after 7 days to be stopped 2 days later (Fig. ). Similarly, starting on day 30, amlodipine and carvedilol had to be tapered off to avoid hypotension (Fig. ). Spironolactone was reduced gradually to 100 mg/d on day 41 (continued for ascites and lower limb edema) (Fig. ). By day 31, urine output normalized and he had mild hyponatremia. On day 37, ADH was 3.9 pg/ml, and sodium, potassium, glucose, and urea 133, 4.8, 5.33, and 5.7 nmol/L, respectively.",

He had a history of pulmonary infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and hiatal hernia. Rivaroxaban was prescribed for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 1 year earlier. Because DVT recurred after discontinuation of rivaroxaban, and no bleeding events occurred, anticoagulant therapy was prolonged after the standard 3-month therapy. The maintenance dose was adjusted to 2.5 mg twice daily after considering his age and low body mass index (BMI) of 19 kg/m2, to reduce the risk of bleeding. He was treated with caspofungin for fungal pneumonia for 2 weeks, then with itraconazole 200 mg twice daily. Three days after beginning itraconazole, he complained of dyspnea. He spent most of the day in bed and denied any history of chest trauma. Medications upon the onset of dyspnea are listed in .\\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was 105/60 mmHg, heart rate: 85 beats/minute, and respiratory rate: 25 breaths/minute with pulse oxygen saturation of 93% upon inhaling 1 L/minute oxygen through a nasal catheter. Pulmonary auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds over the left lower lung. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed left encapsulated pleural effusion and interlobular effusion (). The average Hounsfield units (HU) of the pleural effusion was 25.0 Hu to 30.0 Hu. The patient\u2019s hemoglobin (Hb) level was low, at 65 g/L (normal range: 130\u2013175 g/L); platelet count: 78 \u00d7 109 cells/L (normal range: 125\u2013350 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL); prothrombin time (PT): 17.6 s (normal range: 10.1\u201312.6 s); international normalized ratio (INR): 1.52; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 30.5 s (normal range: 26.9\u201337.6 s); and trough concentration of anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) activity: 0.80 IU/mL. The serum creatinine level was 132 \u03bcmol/L (normal range: 44\u2013133 \u03bcmol/L), and the serum alanine transaminase level was 10 IU/L (normal range: 9\u201350 IU/L).

Thoracentesis was performed with a 16-Fr catheter inserted after discontinuation of rivaroxaban for 24 hours. Approximately 600 mL of grossly bloody pleural effusion was drained on the first day. Dyspnea improved soon after the thoracentesis and drainage. Analysis of the pleural fluid showed a hematocrit (Hct) of 13.0% and a white blood count of 5290 \u00d7 106 cells/L. Bacterial Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli smear for tuberculosis, and bacterial culture, and cytology to detect malignant cells, were negative. Peripheral blood (PB) Hct was 24.6% on the same day, and the ratio of pleural to PB Hct was >0.5, confirming the diagnosis of hemothorax. The catheter was removed 7 days later when the daily drainage was <100 mL for 3 consecutive days. The total drainage volume was approximately 1705 mL.\\nChest CT showed that the pleural effusion had resolved without new-onset effusion 3 months after effusion drainage and discontinuation of rivaroxaban (). When the patient was stable, the indication for anticoagulation was reassessed, and the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation was evaluated. Ultrasonography showed that there was no DVT in either lower extremity.",

The patient stated that she was standing by her dresser when she suddenly started having palpitations, diaphoresis, and nausea. After that, she lost consciousness for a few seconds and fell to the floor (no head trauma). She denied any prodromal dizziness, light-headedness, or vertigo. The patient was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease nine months prior to presentation. The patient stated that she was instructed by her endocrinologist to discontinue her methimazole for one week as she was scheduled to undergo elective radioiodine ablation of the thyroid. A recent thyroid uptake study showed 83% homogeneous uptake in the thyroid, consistent with graves thyrotoxicosis. The patient presented to the hospital five days after discontinuing her methimazole. She also reported palpitations, poor appetite, feeling anxious, and fatigue since stopping her medication. Home medications included aspirin 81 mg daily, metoprolol succinate ER 25 mg daily, sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg twice daily, spironolactone 25 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, and methimazole 20 mg daily. The patient denied any past surgical history except for AICD placement. Social and family histories were significant only for Graves' disease in biological mother.\\nOn admission, patient vitals were a pulse of 90 (regular), blood pressure of 104/58, respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable. Patients labs were significant for TSH of less than 0.005 (reference range 0.270-4.200 mcIU/mL), free T3 of 21.3 (reference range 0.20-4.40 pg/mL), and free T4 of greater than 7.77 (reference range 0.90-1.71 ng/dL). chest X-ray was negative for acute pathology. Initial ECG showed nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay and severe QTc prolongation of 607 ms (Figure ). Medical record review showed patient recently followed up with a primary care physician who obtained thyroid studies and ECG. The patient\u2019s QTc interval three weeks prior to admission was 437 (Figure ). Thyroid function testing showed TSH of less than 0.005, free T4 of 4.7, and free T3 of 8.80. During her visit, methimazole was increased from 10 mg daily to 20 mg daily. Thus, the patient\u2019s QTc increased from 437 ms to 607 ms (Figures and 2) after discontinuing methimazole for five days. AICD interrogation revealed the patient had an episode of VF (same time as syncope occurred) and received an appropriate shock (Figure ). AICD also showed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) prior to VF (Figure ). Although not apparent on our patient\u2019s AICD interrogation, the PVCs could have fallen on a T-wave from a previous contraction enabling the \u201cR-on-T\u201d phenomenon, which possibly triggered her VF []. The patient was found to have frequent PVCs on both AICD and in-hospital ECGs (Figures and 4). Patient\u2019s magnesium on admission was 2.1 (reference range 1.7-2.6 mg/dL) and potassium was 3.9 (reference range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L). Troponin and Pro-BNP were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a stable ejection fraction of 25%, no acute wall motion abnormalities, and no new structural pathologies when compared to the previous TTE done six months ago. Therefore, the likelihood of an electrolyte abnormality, myocardial ischemia or infarct, or new structural abnormality as the cause of VF was less likely. Further record review traced the patient\u2019s diagnosis of hyperthyroidism to nine months ago, where she had a QTc of 397 (Figure ). Thyroid studies showed TSH <0.005, free T4 of 2.08, and normal free T3 at 4.05.\\nEndocrinology was consulted and recommended the initiation of methimazole at a dose of 30 mg every six hours. EP Cardiology also recommended the initiation of antithyroid medication, avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs, maintenance of potassium above 4 and magnesium above 2, and serial ECG for QTc monitor. On day 2 of admission, and after receiving a high dose of methimazole for 24 hours (onset of action 12-16 hours), repeat ECG showed QTc of 431 (Figure ).",

The legal representative of the patient signed informed consent for publication.\\nAt first presentation in a primary care center, the patient was comatose and intubated. Activated charcoal was administered at an early point of time; however, no subsequent waking reaction occurred. An initial CT scan of the brain () revealed a left-hemispheric deep intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Upon admission, blood pressure was in normal range with no documented history of arterial hypertension. There was no medication history of anticoagulants nor was there a reported history of alcohol or drug abuse or any preexisting diseases such as arterial hypertension or liver insufficiency. Laboratory results showed a normal platelet cell count (218/\u03bcl), standard coagulation parameters (PTT: 26 s, INR: 0.9), and liver function (GPT: 30 U/l). Factor XIII was normal (85%). There were no signs of any preceding head trauma.

        "note": "A 36-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, depression, substance abuse, and dyslipidemia presented to the hospital after an intentional overdose with tizanidine. He was found by a friend in a state of reduced consciousness and severe weakness. He had consumed alcohol the night prior to presentation and had been vomiting profusely per report. In line with his presention, there were several abnormalities on his chemistry panel, including severe hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and acute kidney injury. Initial potassium concentration was 2.7 mmol/L; sodium concentration, 140 mmol/L magnesium, 1.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL (with a previously noted baseline of 0.8 mg/dL). Initial blood pressure was 105/68 mm/Hg, pulse was 82 bpm, and temperature was 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit. On physical exam he appeared to be comfortable and was cooperative. His head was atraumatic, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. He had flat neck veins, and the lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally. His abdomen was soft with normal active bowel sounds. He had no dependent edema. He had reduced muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities in a symmetrical fashion and had reduced patellar reflexes bilaterally. Results from an electrocardiogram were abnormal. He was found to have mild prolongation of the QT interval (corrected QT [QTc] 497 ms) with the presence of U waves having the appearance of T-U fusion waves (Fig. ). Home medications included atorvastatin, levothyroxine, cetirizine, lisinopril, and tizanidine 4 mg every 6 h as needed.\\nHe was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with continuous monitoring of his cardiac telemetry. The inpatient nephrology service was promptly consulted. He was provided with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (lactated Ringers + 40 meq KCl/L at 125 ml/h); additional potassium replacement began in earnest both orally and parenterally. He was also administered magnesium sulfate 4 gm intravenously. Serial chemistries were ordered every 4 h. Further laboratory testing revealed an ethanol level of 219 mg/dL; acetaminophen, salicylates, and tricyclics were undectable. The urine drug screen was positive for cocaine. With further hydration and electrolyte replacement, his sensorium improved and he revealed that he had ingested 80 mg of tizanidine with 24 ounces of beer approximately 20 h before his initial presentation to the Emergency Department. The cocaine use was nearly a week prior to his presentation.\\nTwenty-four hours after admission, after having received 100 mEq of potassium chloride his potassium remained extremely low at 2.8 mmol/L. At this point, the serum magnesium level had improved to 1.9 mg/dL. Repeat ECG confirmed ongoing mild QT prolongation with QTc of 497 ms. The patient\u2019s urine potassium level was abnormally elevated at 38 mEq/L (should be < 20 mEq/L in the setting of severe hypokalemia), alluding to a defect in renal potassium handling, and not losses of gastrointestinal secretions which would have led to renal potassium conservation. Since he had achieved resolution of his acute kidney injury (creatinine was now down to 0.81 mg/dL), oral spironolactone 25 mg twice daily was started. The patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit to the cardiac step-down unit for ongoing monitoring of his telemetry and rhythm. Despite further improvement in his magnesium levels (> 2.0 mg/dL), his hypokalemia persisted for approximately 72 h more, during which time he required > 100 mEq daily, totaling nearly 500 meq. The potassium levels finally stabilized at 4.5 mmol/L.",

        "note": "A 53-year-old African American man was brought in by his wife with new-onset seizures. The patient was unable to provide an accurate history due to altered mental status. Per the patient's wife, the patient had stopped drinking alcohol 24\u201348 hours prior to admission due to financial constraints, after consuming two pints of whiskey per day for the previous 10 years. The seizures began the evening prior to admission and continued throughout the night. These episodes lasted 1-2 seconds, were tonic-clonic in nature, and were associated with urinary incontinence and foaming at the mouth. His past medical history was significant only for hypertension. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 48 years. Upon arrival, his temperature was 37.1 degrees Celsius, pulse was 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 160/98 mmHg. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, abdominal exam disclosed hepatosplenomegaly, and neurologic exam was significant for tremulousness. The patient was disoriented on mental status exam. Mean corpuscular volume was 92.3 fL, platelet count was 58 \u00d7 103 per \u03bcL, AST was 199 units/L, and ALT was 89 units/L. An ECG done upon arrival revealed a normal sinus rhythm and QTc interval of 546 ms.\\nGiven the recent onset of seizure-like episodes, history of abrupt discontinuation of chronic alcohol use, exam findings, and lab values consistent with ethanol abuse, a diagnosis of acute alcohol withdrawal was suspected. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Treatment was initiated with diazepam 5 mg IV every 8 hours and lorazepam 2 mg IV every 1 hour as needed for agitation and anxiety. The patient was also given 100 mg of thiamine, 1 mg of folic acid, and 2 gm of magnesium sulfate IV every 24 hours.\\nDuring the 1st hospital day, the patient exhibited witnessed tonic-clonic seizure activity, as well as significant anxiety and agitation. During the 2nd and 3rd hospital day, the patient's mental status fluctuated significantly. Intermittently, the patient was severely agitated, attempting to dislodge his indwelling urinary catheter and requiring 4-point soft restraints. Throughout this period, temperature peaked at 37.4 degrees Celsius, pulse ranged from 71 to 99 beats/minute, and blood pressure ranged from 118 to 154/88\u2013103 mmHg. Diazepam was changed to 7.5 mg PO every 6 hours; however the patient still required lorazepam 2 mg IV every 4 hours for anxiety and agitation.\\nOn the 4th hospital day, the patient developed hypotension. Blood pressure was 90\u2013100/70\u201380 mmHg, and pulse was 82\u201399 beats/minute. The patient was significantly altered and was therefore unable to report subjective symptoms. ECG disclosed symmetric deep coving T waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V2\u2013V6, as well as a prolonged QTc interval of 645 ms. Serum troponin I was elevated at 1.25 ng/mL. Repeat ECGs continued to show symmetric T wave inversions in the inferior limb and lateral chest leads. Serial troponin levels, however, trended downward. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed multiple left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities, notably akinesis of the mid-distal anteroseptal, mid-distal anterolateral, mid-distal inferoseptal, mid-distal inferolateral, and apical segments (). Of note, right ventricular systolic function was normal, and there was no mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be 40\u201345%. The clinical instability of the patient precluded emergent coronary angiography. Given the widespread repolarization abnormalities by ECG, diffuse wall motion abnormalities involving myocardial segments circumferentially throughout the entire cardiac apex, presence of an identifiable stressor, and downward trend of cardiac troponins, the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy was suspected. The patient continued to require additional doses of lorazepam 2 mg every 2 hours due to agitation and anxiety. On the 5th hospital day, adjunctive treatment with the alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonist dexmedetomidine was initiated to reduce central sympathetic outflow, directly targeting the presumed pathobiology of the stress cardiomyopathy. A loading dose of 1 \u03bcg/kg IV was given over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/hr titrated by 0.1 \u03bcg/kg/hr every 15 minutes to maintain a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of \u22121. The mean infusion rate was 0.31 \u03bcg/kg/hr, administered over a period of 23.93 hours ().\\nOn the 6th hospital day, the patient showed marked clinical improvement. Per the patient's family, mental status was at baseline. The patient denied shortness of breath or chest pain. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were unchanged, and neurologic examination revealed no agitation, anxiety, or tremulousness. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Dexmedetomidine therapy was weaned by 0.1 \u03bcg/kg/hr every 15 minutes. The patient was treated thereafter with tapering doses of diazepam PO, and no additional doses of lorazepam were required. A coronary angiogram was offered to the patient to rule out coronary artery obstruction; however the patient refused the procedure. One month after hospitalization, repeat ECG revealed improvement of the T wave inversions when compared to the ECGs during the event.",

        "note": "A 22-year-old Caucasian woman presented with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, secondary to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started, with return of spontaneous circulation at 19 min, following five external defibrillation shocks. The patient was subsequently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Her past medical history was unremarkable.\\nOn admission, an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with normal ST-segment. TTE excluded regional motion abnormalities, and showed no pericardial effusion, nor indirect signs suggesting aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism; however, it showed biventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricle ejection fraction [LVEF] 45%; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 16 mm) and mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation. Baseline electrolytes were within the normal range, but T-troponin was elevated (68 ng L\u22121 with peak at 225 on the same day; n.v. < 14). Urine and blood toxicology tests were normal. To rule out coronary artery disease, a coronary angiography was performed, showing normal epicardial vessels. CMR was performed on day 5, revealing late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and associated hyperintensity in T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences, in a non-ischemic, subepicardial distribution pattern involving the basal segment of the inferolateral LV wall (A). Since the traditional Lake Louise criteria [] were met, EMB was subsequently planned to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis and identify etiology, and allowed targeted treatment. By right ventricular septal sampling, a histology report on day 10 documented multiple lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates (CD3+ > 7/mm2), with interstitial edema, focal necrosis, and spots of replacement fibrosis (B). Molecular analysis revealed an absence of viral genomes within the myocardial tissue. As is further supported by the identification of circulating anti-intercalated disk and anti-heart autoantibodies in the patient\u2019s serum, a definite diagnosis of autoimmune myocarditis was made. Since frequent polymorphic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), together with short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) were detected on continuous telemonitoring, a single-chamber transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Before discharge, TAPSE was normal (20 mm), but LV systolic function was still mildly reduced (LVEF 48%). The patient was finally discharged on metoprolol 50 mg bid, flecainide 50 mg bid, and ramipril 2.5 mg. In addition, IST was started, consisting of oral prednisone 1 mg kg\u22121 and azathioprine 2 mg kg\u22121.\\nDuring follow-up, IST was well tolerated, and no VA were detected by continuous ICD telemonitoring. After 16 months, since the diagnostic workup revealed normal T-troponin and NTproBNP values, LVEF 58% by TTE, and absence of VA induction on treadmill exercise stress test, IST was withdrawn. However, regularly repeated Holter ECGs (4/year) persistently documented high-burden PVCs, in a range of 5000\u201310,000 daily. PVCs were mainly isolated, with a dominant right-bundle branch block (RBBB) superior axis morphology (A). In addition, early ectopies, as well as couplets, triplets, and bigeminal phases, were frequently documented, preventing the safe withdrawal of betablocker and anti-arrhythmic treatment.\\nAfter three years of clinical stability, the patient experienced two episodes of VF appropriately identified and interrupted by ICD shock (B). On suspicion of arrhythmic myocarditis relapse, she was immediately admitted to hospital for clinical reassessment. Since follow-up CMR was limited by ICD-related artifacts, a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan was ordered: in particular, CT confirmed subepicardial LV basal inferolateral late iodine enhancement consistently with the prior myocarditis, whereas 18F-FDG PET showed non-specific LV capitation, suggesting a low probability of myocarditis recurrence (A). Consistently, T-troponin was normal. To definitely rule out a recurrence of myocarditis, a new EMB was performed, documenting spots of replacement fibrosis with lack of inflammatory infiltrates (B). In the absence of consistent treatment targets, the indication to a new IST cycle was excluded following multidisciplinary reassessment []. Instead, a repeated echocardiogram provided new insights in characterizing the known MVP: in particular, thickened valvular leaflets consistent with Barlow disease were noted, together with basal wall systolic curling (), and a Pickelhaube sign [], i.e., elevated systolic lateral mitral annular velocity (27 cm/s, n.v. < 16) with a typical spiked S wave (). The patient was started on amiodarone.",

        "note": "A 33-year-old previously healthy woman weighing 70 kg was brought to the emergency department (ED) by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in cardiac arrest. The patient was undergoing liposuction of her thighs in a physician\u2019s clinic with no intraoperative complications a few minutes before the event. The surgeon reported harvesting 1.5 L of fat from the patient\u2019s thigh and mid-back during the procedure, which lasted 45 minutes.\\nA few minutes following the procedure, the surgeon noticed that the patient was becoming more somnolent. Her vital signs were stable, including a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg. The doctor suspected a possible clinical manifestation of hypoglycemia and subsequently administered oral dextrose solution without any improvement.\\nTwo hours after the procedure, the patient started feeling dizzy with a rapid decline of her mental status leading to tonic-clonic seizure followed by a complete loss of consciousness. EMS arrived on the scene after five to 10 minutes. EMS personnel reported the patient was gasping, cyanotic, and drooling. During transport to the ED, she had a cardiopulmonary arrest, so the EMS team immediately initiated resuscitation using Basic Life Support guidelines.\\nUpon arrival to the ED, the cardiac monitor showed asystole, so the patient was intubated and resuscitation resumed using the advanced cardiac life support algorithm. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after 12 minutes of resuscitation in the ED (22 minutes post-arrest).\\nThe plastic surgeon who performed the procedure was asked for details about the procedure technique and the anesthesia modality.

        "note": "A 100-year-old female (weight 49 kg, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II) living in an assisted living facility was admitted after a fall, resulting in a displaced fracture of the left femoral neck. She tested positive for novel COVID-19 in the emergency room (ER) prior to transfer to our hospital that same day.\\nHer past medical history was notable for a 30-year prior cerebrovascular accident secondary to arteriovenous malformation, Parkinson\u2019s disease, suprapubic catheter placement and seizure disorder. She normally ambulated with a walker. Her baseline exercise tolerance was < 4 metabolic equivalents (METs). At the time of admission, she complained of a mild headache, but denied shortness of breath, cough, fever, or chills.\\nPreoperative internal medicine consultation was obtained and the patient was also assessed by an anesthesiologist in the COVID-positive inpatient ward. Medications included carbidopa-levodopa, gabapentin, phenobarbital, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen as needed. She had no history of problems with anesthesia, and previously underwent general anesthesia for lumbar spine surgery 6 years prior without complications. On initial examination, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 134/81 mm Hg. Preoperative peripheral nerve blockade was considered to optimize analgesia and reduce opioid risks, but was determined to be unnecessary as the patient reported satisfactory analgesia with minimal opioid use. Preoperative laboratory findings included hematocrit 39.7% and creatinine 0.6 mg/dl. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 83 beats per minute. Her chest x-ray taken at the ER revealed emphysematous changes without opacities.\\nConsent was obtained for surgery after discussion with the patient and her son (a physician and health care proxy). Wearing a surgical face mask, she was brought to an operating room (OR) designated for COVID-positive patients by operating room personnel wearing N95 masks, medical goggles, impermeable disposable gowns, shoe covers, and double caps. The anesthesiologist was also equipped with a powered air-purifying respirator (MAXAIR\u00ae Controlled Air Purifying Respirator). The existing anteroom had designated donning and doffing stations for personal protective equipment (PPE). The OR was a positive-pressure laminar airflow environment with 25 air changes per hour (ACH), without recirculation of air. In addition, a portable High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) 550 cubic feet per minute air scrubber (BD-AS550) was placed near the head of the bed, with outtake flexible ducting (intended to minimize disruption of laminar flow) to the OR wall air return grille.\\nRoutine monitors and a radial arterial catheter were placed. The initial oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula. Pre-induction vital signs included arterial blood pressure of 173/89 mm Hg, and a heart rate of 80. Without sedation, the patient was carefully placed in a right lateral decubitus position. Communication was continually maintained with the awake patient to minimize discomfort. Spinal anesthesia was performed using sterile technique at the L4/5 level with bupivacaine (preservative free) 0.5%, 2.5 mL. The patient tolerated the spinal well without complications. Prior to incision, intravenous cefazolin (1000 mg) and tranexamic acid (10 mg/kg) were administered. Hemodynamic stability was observed throughout the procedure, with a targeted MAP of 90 to 100 mm Hg. Ninety minutes into the 130 min-long procedure, 20 mcg of fentanyl was administered after the patient became restless, complaining of dependent shoulder pain. No other sedation was provided. A restrictive intraoperative fluid regimen was used (500 mL of Lactated Ringers). Estimated blood loss was 150 mL and urine output was 100 mL.\\nPostoperatively, analgesia was provided with tramadol (25\u201350 mg every 8 hr as needed) and oral acetaminophen (650 mg every 6 hr). A lidocaine patch was added on postoperative day (POD) 1 for a highest recorded pain level of Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 9. Subsequent pain scores ranged from NRS 2-8. A sequential compression device (PlexiPulse\u00ae) and enoxaparin (30 mg daily) were used for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Blood products were not administered and the lowest hematocrit of 26.1% was noted on POD 7.\\nOnset of cough without dyspnea was noted on POD 2, generating concern for progression of COVID-19. Fortunately, oxygen requirements never exceeded 3 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula resulting in an of SpO2 93% to 99%. Additional laboratory findings at that time included elevated lactate dehydrogenase (554 unit/L), ferritin (414.8 ng/mL), D-dimer (607 ng/mL), C-reactive protein (41.5 mg/dL), procalcitonin (0.44 ng/mL), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (83 mm/hr). After internal medicine consultation, HCQ therapy was initiated (600 mg twice daily for two doses, then 400 mg daily for four additional days).",

        "note": "Our patient was a 70-year-old white Anatolian Turkish woman with primary school education who had been living alone for the past five years. She presented to our Psychiatry Department complaining of \u2018feeling large worms moving in her body\u2019. The complaint had been present for the past six months and started after she presented to an internist with complaints of weight loss, bilateral fine tremor of the upper extremities, shaking, sweating, palpitations and intolerance to heat. After the evaluation, she was hospitalized for a diagnostic work-up in our Endocrinology Department with a preliminary diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Restlessness, increased speech and the feeling of \u2018large worms migrating through her body\u2019 were observed on the second day of hospitalization.\\nAfter psychiatric consultation, our patient was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition (hyperthyroidism). She was started on 2mg/day of haloperidol. This treatment was chosen because of the preliminary nature of the diagnosis and because our patient may have had delirium. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed five nodules measuring 2mm to 5mm in the left lobe and a heterogeneous nodule measuring 5mm to 10mm in the right lobe. None of the nodules displayed microcalcification, solidity or a reduced echogenicity pattern. The solitary nodule in the right lobe displayed an irregular contour. Lymphadenopathy and invasion of the neighboring structures were not noted. Scintigraphy revealed that all of the nodules were hyperfunctioning. She had no history of exposure to ionizing or environmental toxins, and no personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia. A fine needle aspiration biopsy ruled out malignancy. The level of antibody to thyroid stimulating hormone receptor was found to be 2.5IU/L, thereby confirming Graves' disease.\\nAs a result of the surgical consultation, medical follow-up was advised. On the third day, propylthiouracil 150mg/day and propranolol 30mg/day were started and the doses were maintained at 100mg/day and 40mg/day, respectively, after the first week. Restlessness, increased speech and DP remitted on the 10th day of treatment and haloperidol was stopped. She was discharged on the 20th day with a prescription of levothyroxine sodium 100\u03bcg/day (weight, 59kg; dose, 1.7\u03bcg/kg/day). A fortnight after discharge, she started to feel the worms. After presenting to the Departments of Dermatology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Endocrinology, and Neurology, she was referred to the Department of Psychiatry and hospitalized. Her past medical and psychiatric histories were negative for pathology and her family history did not reveal evidence of psychopathology. She was teetotal and she was receiving no drugs or supplements at the time of evaluation other than levothyroxine sodium. She had no history of drug use or abuse and an inpatient follow-up lasting a month did not reveal any signs or symptoms of withdrawal.\\nAt the baseline examination, she was noted to be cooperative and have reduced self-grooming. Her speech was fluent although restricted to the topic of tapeworms. Her mood and affect were anxious. She was orientated to people, space and time. Her attention, concentration and memory were within normal limits. She reported tactile hallucinations. Her judgment, reality testing and abstract thinking were impaired and her thought process was perseverative and circumferential. Her thought content was positive for somatic delusions. Motor retardation was observed while sleep and appetite were normal. Assessment with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Mini Mental State Examination revealed scores of 82 (positive: 19; negative: 18; general psychopathology: 45) and 28, respectively.\\nLaboratory examinations including levels of vitamin B12, folate and ferritin, the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test, and a toxicology screen were within normal limits other than elevated thyroid function tests (our patient was noncompliant with her levothyroxine treatment, Table\\n). After an endocrinology consultation, it was advised that she be followed without medication for a month; thereafter, levothyroxine sodium 100\u03bcg/day was restarted. Consultations from the departments of Internal Medicine, Neurology, Hematology and Oncology ruled out the presence of an organic disorder. Electroencephalography and cranial magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Therefore our patient was diagnosed as having DP, presumably secondary to the hyperthyroidism. A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated a corrected QT interval (QTc) duration of 450ms. Previous ECGs revealed that her QTc duration varied between 440ms and 490ms. Therefore, psychiatric treatment was initiated with pimozide 2mg/day and later the dose was titrated to 4mg/day. At the eighth week of treatment her thyroid function tests returned to normal limits along with a remission of the delusions.",

During physical examination in 1988, a height of 1.52 m, a weight of 105 kg, and a body mass index of 45.5 kg/m2 were observed. Relevant lab results performed in 1988 are shown in , and included elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and a serum calcium on the lower end of normal. Although it is unknown when her first symptoms of hypocalcemia started, in the years prior to the established diagnosis of PHP, she frequently had complaints of paresthesia and muscle spasms in her right hand with intermitting neck pain.\\nClinical features that supported the diagnosis of PHP1a in 1988 with AHO included the patients' hereditary obesity and physical features such as a round face, low nasal bridge, and short nose and neck. Because of the clear clinical depiction of her symptoms related to AHO, our patient did not undergo genetic testing. The diagnosis PHP was established after the administration of intravenous PTH (200 IU), in which no increase of 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in serum and urine, or urine phosphate levels were observed. The patient had a daughter who also received injections of PTH, where in contrast, levels of cAMP increased in both serum and urine after PTH administration. Thus, no PHP was diagnosed in her daughter. Furthermore, she had two other sons who were also not diagnosed with PHP.\\nSince diagnosis our patient had been taking calcitriol (0.25 micrograms each day) for her PHP1a, which was later replaced by combined treatment of calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol in 2012 (current dosage: 1000 mg/880 I.E.). Hand radiography was performed in 2004, which displayed shortened phalanges and evident shortening of the metacarpals III-V in both hands ().\\nOn current evaluation, lab results confirmed the presence of metabolic hyperkalemia, with elevated levels of PTH, and normal 25-OH-vitamin D levels (). She was classified with Type G3b renal insufficiency in 2009, with the most recent estimated glomerular filtration rate value of 39 mL/min/1.73m2. Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm of 63/min and narrow QRS morphology.",

        "note": "A 79-year-old female presented to the emergency department following a road traffic accident. She described feeling weak while driving before the collision. She was wearing a seatbelt and was uninjured.\\nHer medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyslipidaemia, constipation, hypertension and she was an ex-smoker as she quit smoking two months earlier. Her medications included Lercanidipine 10 mg, Aspirin 75 mg, Ezetimibe/Simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg, Lactulose as required, and Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium 85mcg/43mcg.\\nShe had attended her GP on multiple occasions over the previous two months feeling generally weak and lethargic. She was noted to be hypertensive, requiring increasing doses of her antihypertensive medications. Laboratory tests with her GP showed hypokalaemia and she was commenced on oral potassium supplements.\\nOn our initial assessment she was hypertensive, blood pressure 180/69. She was of slim build (body mass index(BMI) of 20.2 kg/m2) with no cushingoid features, clinical examination was unremarkable and there was no traumatic injury. ECG at presentation showed sinus rhythm with left axis deviation, left bundle-branch block, and QT prolongation of 502 ms. Labs revealed severe hypokalaemia (K 2.2 mmol/l), normal renal function (Urea 3.4 mmol/L, Creatinine 54ummol/L, Na 143 mmol/L), normal serum magnesium (Mg 0.79 mmol/L) with metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.53, PCO2 5.4 (40.3mmhg), PO2 7.1 (53.3mmhg), HCO3 34). Spot urinary potassium was 22 mmol/l. Chest x-ray on admission showed mild cardiomegaly, and there was no active lung disease (Fig. ). CT Brain reported no acute findings.\\nOur impression was severe hypokalaemia and hypertension with metabolic alkalosis secondary to hyperaldosteronism. Differential diagnoses included primary hyperaldosteronism, secondary hyperaldosteronism, or due to medications/food. Further workup was sent including; plasma renin, serum aldosterone, urinary electrolytes. She was managed with aggressive potassium replacement, requiring 80 mmol i.v. potassium chloride (KCl) daily for four days (total 240 mmol i.v. KCl) to achieve a serum potassium level above 3.5 mmol/L. Her systolic blood pressure settled below 150mmhg.\\nOn day five of her admission, our patient developed a hypertensive emergency (BP 239/114 mmHg) with acute pulmonary oedema requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral air space opacifications and perihilar haze, with bilateral pleural effusions in keeping with pulmonary oedema (Fig. ). She was managed with i.v. Furosemide 160 mg/24 h, Isosorbide dinitrate infusion 2.5 mg/hr for 8 h, and oral spironolactone 50 mg once daily. Pulmonary oedema resolved within 24 h and blood pressure improved to 130/55 mmHg. She was changed from i.v. furosemide to oral Furosemide/Amiloride 40/5 mg. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricle size and function, paradoxical septal motion consistent with left bundle branch block, mildly dilated left atrium, and right ventricular systolic pressure less than 35 mmHg. On review of her imaging, a recent CT thorax was noted to include the adrenal glands. This was reviewed and reported no evidence of adrenal adenomas or hyperplasia Fig. .\\nWe revisited the clinical history. On further questioning, she reported struggling with nicotine cravings since quitting smoking two months earlier. She began eating excessive amounts of liquorice sweets to satisfy her nicotine cravings. The liquorice sweets she was eating contained 4% liquorice root extract. The estimated intake was 1.14gm-2.28gm liquorice extract per day for the previous two months. She continued to eat liquorice while in hospital until admission to the ICU. She was advised to stop consuming liquorice once the medical team became aware.\\nFurther investigations returned. Her urinary potassium was noted to be inappropriately normal [24 h Urinary Potassium: 57.3 (25\u2013125) mmol/24 h] in the setting of severe hypokalaemia with high urinary sodium [24 h Urinary Sodium: 353.4 pg/ml(40-220 pg/ml)]. Elevated urinary sodium excretion was likely due to diuretic therapy and the production of natriuretic peptides in response to hypervolemia. Plasma renin and serum aldosterone taken day three of admission were both suppressed [Plasma renin 4.4 pg/ml(< 20 pg/ml), Serum Aldosterone < 26 pg/ml (42\u2013209 pg/ml)] suggestive of an extra-adrenal mimic causing a pseudo-aldosteronism. This was in keeping with a diagnosis of acquired apparent mineralocorticoid excess secondary to excessive Liquorice ingestion. Her serum potassium and systolic blood pressure began to normalise following the cessation of Liquorice. Furosemide/Amiloride was reduced to 20 mg/5 mg during admission and was discontinued 10 days after discharge. Her serum potassium remained within the normal range in the following weeks and her blood pressure normalised. Her follow-up ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and left bundle-branch block.",

The patient was sitting on the side of her bed when she suddenly lost consciousness falling to the floor striking the right side of her face. She sustained significant facial trauma; however there were no signs of intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan of the brain. She described palpitations with chest pressure prior to the event. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) reported by emergency medical services did not reveal any acute arrhythmias, such as TdP. Due to the complaints of chest pressure she was evaluated for cardiac ischemia utilizing cardiac biomarkers, CKMB and Troponin I. A total of three sets were completed every eight hours apart; all studies were reported within normal limits ruling out cardiac ischemia. Troponin I values were less than 0.045 ng/mL and CKMB values were all less than 0.5 ng/mL. ECG on presentation revealed 1st-degree AV block with corrected QT (QTc) interval of 689 ms (). Patient's ECG from two years prior showed a baseline prolonged QTc interval of 500 (). She was evaluated for reversible causes of QT interval prolongation including electrolyte derangements, medications, and SLE flare. Her electrolytes were within normal limits including potassium (3.9 mmol/L), magnesium (2.3 mg/dL), phosphorous (4.2 mg/dL), and calcium (9.0 mg/dL). C3 levels were low, with normal C4 and ESR, and anti-dsDNA was negative making SLE flare unlikely. Patient continued to have dialysis on her normally scheduled days.\\nAfter evaluation by electrophysiology there was concern for presumed TdP due to her clinical presentation and grossly abnormal QTc interval. She was placed on mexiletine 150 mg BID and was initially recommended to have defibrillator implantation to protect against sudden cardiac death from cardiac arrhythmias. Evaluation of the patient's medications revealed that she was taking HCQ for the past two years for treatment of refractory SLE. HCQ was discontinued and the patient's QT interval slowly decreased to a QTc interval of 500 over the next 7 days (). She was monitored on the telemetry unit for one week and did not have any further arrhythmic events.",

His initial vital signs showed him to be tachycardic at 140 beats per minute, hypertensive at 153/100 millimeters mercury, and tachypneic at 30 breaths per minute, but afebrile, with normal oxygen saturations in the upper nineties on room air. His exam did not reveal signs of trauma. His lungs were clear, and he had no rigidity or clonus. He would occasionally flex his upper extremities such as with stimuli from intravenous line placement, but maintained extended, arched posture.\\nThe patient was immediately given 2.5 mg of midazolam intravenously, which partially relieved his opisthotonos within a few minutes. Instead of nearly constant extensor posturing of the neck it became more intermittent, and arching of the back lessened. A few minutes later he was given an additional 2.5 mg of midazolam, and a few minutes thereafter, cessation of the opisthotonos was noted. His heart rate declined to between 100\u2013110 beats per minute. His breathing also notably slowed to a rate between 20\u201325 respirations per minute, and his blood pressure normalized.\\nUpon chart review it was determined that the patient had visited two local hospitals in the prior two days for similar although less severe decompensation of his known mental illness. He was also noted at those times not to be taking his prescribed aripiprazole. He had been given one dose of aripiprazole in the ED the day before the index presentation, but according to family had not taken any since, and as previously noted had not taken his aripiprazole for 3\u20134 weeks. He was not known to take any other medications. He had been known to use marijuana and cocaine in the past. In 2018 his tetanus was noted to be up to date, but it was unclear when it would need to be updated.\\nThe patient had a long history of medication noncompliance and trialing of multiple antipsychotic medications. Earliest available records in 2017 showed that he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at that time and was initially started on risperidone. He had immediately stopped taking the risperidone and hydroxyzine after discharge and had a long history of re-admissions for decompensations when not taking his medications.\\nAn initial workup was notable for a normal blood glucose and normal electrolytes with the exception of a potassium of 2.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (reference range: 3.6\u20135.2 mm/L). Magnesium was 1.8 mg per deciliter (dL) (1.7\u20132.2 mg/dL).",

Finding no pulse or signs of breathing, her coworkers immediately called emergency medical services (EMS) and initiated chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth respirations. The EMS arrived 9 min after the cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and attached and activated an automated external defibrillator (AED). Defibrillation was successful, resulting in termination of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (Fig. ). Her circulation spontaneously returned 14 min after CPA. She was subsequently transferred to our hospital.\\nUpon arrival at the hospital, her consciousness was three points (E1V1M1) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Her spontaneous breathing was weak, so she was intubated and connected to a respirator. Blood values were within the normal range, except for positive human fatty acid-binding protein.

She had experienced four syncopal episodes at school during the last three years. All of these episodes occurred while resting or in class. Her mother noticed the patient's very unusual snoring sound with transient loss of consciousness twice at night, and what seemed like agonal respiration. After that, she had palpitations with presyncope while writing in class. She had a past history of patch repair surgery for ventricular septal defect (VSD) at the age of 5 months old, however, there was no abnormality in the physical examination or laboratory findings, and echocardiography showed her heart to be completely normal morphologically and functionally. The only abnormal finding was prolonged QTc (629 ms) in surface 12 lead electrocardiography (ECG) (). She had no family history of sudden death or other genetic heart disease (). At the time when she was referred to our hospital, she was taking low dose of propranolol. Because ECG at the time of presyncope or syncope had not been documented and her clinical presentation was unusual, we stopped propranolol and performed an epinephrine test.\\nAfter skipping propranolol for 5 times its half life, an epinephrine provocation test was performed and mean QTc was measured after epinephrine test., Mean QTc was significantly prolonged (637.0-48.6 ms; between 585 and 646 ms), and frequent single or couplets of ventricular premature beats appeared (). We then repeated the epinephrine test with \u03b2-blocker medication. With propranolol 120 mg per day, mean QTc was prolonged as 628.5\u00b162.7 ms (between 618 and 634 ms), and non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT; 200 bpm) appeared following R-on-T phenomenon and spontaneously ended within 8 sec without syncopal event (). There were two different premature ventricular contraction (PVC) morphologies, and non-sustained VT initiating PVC was localized by 12 lead ECG (). The origin of PVC seems to be left ventricular (LV) high septum just below the (left) distal HIS bundle. QRS duration is relatively narrow and purely negative in lead aVR and aVF, but initially positive in all other leads, suggesting LV peri-Hissian PVC related to membranous VSD repair. After increasing the dosage of propranolol to 160 mg per day for 3 days, sustained polymorphic VT was induced spontaneously, requiring external defibrillation, and syncope and tonic clonic seizure were documented during the epinephrine provocation test ().",

An external PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, on March 19, 2020, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our university hospital due to acute respiratory insufficiency leading to an endotracheal intubation and progressive deterioration of his general condition (SAPS II 77, SOFA 15). Based on the Berlin criteria, a severe ARDS was diagnosed []. The severity of illness was reevaluated by SAPS II and SOFA score every 24 hours. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by another PCR test in our hospital two days after admission.\\nThe following day and despite positive fluid balancing and broad anti-infective therapy including meropenem, vancomycin, azithromycine, itraconazole, and acyclovir, an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) plasma level (4118 pg/mL) was noticed accompanied by fever and hemodynamic instability with norepinephrine demand of 1.2 mg/h.\\nIn addition to broad anti-infective therapy, intermittent prone positioning was initiated. In the evening of March 21, 2020, the patient developed a generalized hyperinflammatory condition with markedly elevated inflammatory parameters (IL-6 4302 pg/mL) and acute renal failure (KDIGO 3), requiring initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient was treated with CiCa \u00ae-CVVHD (MultiFiltrate, Fresenius AG, Germany, citrate anticoagulation). CRRT (using a high-flow dialysis catheter) was operated with a blood flow rate of 100 mL/min, dialysate flow of 2000 mL/h, ultrafiltration of 250 mL/h, citrate flow of 4 mmol/L, and calcium flow of 1.7 mmol/L. We additionally administered intravenous unfractionated heparin with a target partial thromboplastin time of 40-50 seconds in the presence of leukostasis in underlying CLL and for thromboprophylaxis in SARS-CoV-2 infection. At this point, after escalated anti-infective therapy failed to decrease inflammatory markers and a further clinical deterioration, we installed a CytoSorb\u00ae hemoadsorber into the CRRT circuit in order to control the hyperinflammatory response. The cartridge was placed before the hemofilter. Within 30 minutes after the initiation of CytoSorb\u00ae treatment, IL-6 levels had already dropped to 2495 pg/mL, and within 24 hours, hemodynamic stabilization began while norepinephrine requirements could be progressively reduced. Simultaneously, PaO2/FiO2 increased from 90 to 165 mmHg under Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) ventilation (SAPS II 70, SOFA 15) (). CytoSorb\u00ae therapy was terminated after 9.2 hours of uninterrupted application in the morning of March 22, 2020. After termination of CytoSorb\u00ae therapy, hydrocortisone treatment was started for supportive therapy. During the next two days following discontinuation of CytoSorb\u00ae treatment, hyperinflammation could be kept well under control with IL-6 levels dropping further to 20.8 pg/mL (SAPS II 68, SOFA 12). Negative fluid balancing was possible, and norepinephrine administration was tapered off three days after cessation of hemoadsorption therapy. Analgosedation could be reduced, and the patient could be progressively weaned from ventilation. Ten days after CytoSorb\u00ae discontinuation, the patient was extubated (SAPS II 68).",

Arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypoxia and metabolic acidosis with hyperlactatemia. Blood examinations revealed elevated inflammatory markers and impaired renal function (Table ). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis with 30% LVEF and no findings suggesting infective endocarditis. Computed tomography revealed consolidation of the lower left lung lobe. He was diagnosed with pneumonia, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure.\\nAfter admission, antibiotics (meropenem, linezolid, clindamycin, and minomycin), hydrocortisone, vasopressors (norepinephrine and vasopressin), and landiolol were initiated. Continuous renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation therapy were also initiated. Before introducing ECMO, the ventilator was set to the airway pressure release mode (high airway pressure, 16 cm H2O; fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.6). Blood gas analysis showed pCO2 46.1 mmHg and pO2 116 mmHg. However, hyperlactatemia and tachycardia persisted, and purpura appeared over the limbs and trunk. The TTE findings on the second hospitalization day revealed refractory cardiac failure with 10% LVEF regardless of the improving oxygenation; thus, septic cardiomyopathy was suspected. His hemodynamics remained unstable; metabolic acidosis progressed despite intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement on day 2. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in the blood and sputum cultures. Because of his intractable shock, V-A ECMO was implemented as a bridging therapy on day 3.",

Clinical examination revealed rales over both lungs and tachycardia without heart murmurs. Abdomen was soft and painless with audible peristalsis. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia of 125/min.\\nOn admission, we started continuous ECG monitoring, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure measurements and inserted central venous, arterial and urine catheters to measure central venous pressure intermittently, arterial blood pressure continuously and diuresis per hour.\\nWe suspected sepsis with septic shock and immediately started treatment of shock and diagnostic procedures for sepsis. We managed shock initially by rapid infusion of crystalloids until we confirmed fluid unresponsiveness by ultrasound of inferior vena cava, demonstrating its diameter of 2.2 cm, that did not change with inspiration. Therefore, we started noradrenalin infusion within the first 15 min and up titrated it to 66\u03bcg/min.

Among admission laboratory data we observed lactacidosis (arterial pH 7.24, bicarb 13.4 mmol/l, pCO2 4.24 kPa, pO2 13 kPa, lactate 7.5 mmol/l), thrombocytopenia (62 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), leucocytosis, increase of procalcitonin to 100 ng/ml, C-reactive protein (CRP) to 166 mg/l, N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) to 2114 pmol/l, myoglobin to 482\u03bcg/l, and serum creatinine to 288 \u03bcg/l. Admission SOFA score was eight. We collected hemocultures, urinoculture and aspirates as soon as possible and after that immediately administered imipenem 500 mg/6 h IV.\\nAfter the first 24 h positive pneumococcal urine antigen confirmed streptococcal pneumonia. We continued imipenem therapy and adjusted the dose to renal failure. Other microbiological cultures remained negative. Together with the specialist for infectious disease we decided to continue imipenem therapy due to prior disease, including splenectomy.\\nAfter 24 h of ICU-stay the patient needed 40% oxygen by mask to achieve satisfactory blood gases (pH 7.2, bicarb 15 mmol/l, paCO2 5.35 kPa, paO2 8.5 kPa), her body temperature was 38 \u00b0C. SatcvO2 was 76.1%. Luckily, the patient did not need neither non-invasive, nor invasive ventilation during the entire ICU stay.\\nIn spite of all treatments, after the first 24 h multiorgan failure syndrome persisted, including severe systolic myocardial dysfunction with left ventricular EF of 20%, measured by echocardiography. SOFA score at that time was 12.\\nAfter 36 h of ICU stay resistant septic shock with high-dose catecholamine support, left ventricular dysfunction with EF of 20% persited and renal failure (serum creatinine 379\u03bcmol/l, daily urine output < 500 ml) worsened. SatcvO2 was 78%, body temperature 37 \u00b0C.",

        "note": "An 80-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital with complaints of fever and left leg pain, as well as bilateral lower extremity swelling. Although mild edema was always observed in his bilateral lower extremities, it gradually worsened 1 week prior to admission. On the day of admission, he had high fever accompanied by chills. He denied any recent leg trauma. His past medical history was significant for pulmonary tuberculosis at 30 years of age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). A pacemaker was inserted because of atrial fibrillation (AF) with symptomatic bradycardia. He was an ex-tobacco smoker (100 pack year history) and did not drink alcohol. His maintenance medications were dabigatran (220 mg), furosemide (20 mg), and an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting \u03b22-agonist.\\nAt initial presentation, he was alert and oriented but appeared distressed. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.8 \u00b0C; blood pressure, 135/90 mmHg; heart rate, 96 beats per minute with irregular rhythm; blood oxygen saturation, 93% with room air; and respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute. He had a barrel-shaped chest, coarse crackles were heard over the lung base, and wheezes were heard over both lung fields. Pitting edema was observed in his lower extremities. His left foot had more erythema and edema than his right foot (Fig. ). His left lower extremity was warm and tender to touch. There were no skin breaks or other potential infection entry sites. Tinea pedis was ascertained by a potassium hydroxide test.\\nArterial blood gas analysis showed the following results: pH, 7.408; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 44 mmHg; partial pressure of oxygen, 72 mmHg; bicarbonate, 22.5 mmol/L; and lactate, 1.8 mmol/L. A complete blood count revealed the following results: white blood cells, 9,000/\u03bcL; red blood cells, 384 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; hemoglobin, 12.4 g/dL; and platelets, 9.6 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL. Chemistry results were as follows: serum creatinine, 0.81 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 19.0 mg/dL; albumin, 3.7 g/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 43 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 22 U/L; C-reactive protein, 0.36 mg/dl; and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 471 pg/mL (our patient\u2019s basal BNP level was approximately 100 pg/mL). A coagulation test showed prolonged prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (1.29) and activated partial thromboplastin time (52.3 seconds). A chest X-ray showed a nodular lesion on the right pulmonary apex compatible with previous tuberculous infection without any infiltrations. An electrocardiogram showed AF with pacemaker rhythm without any sensing and pacing failures. Based on these results, we diagnosed our patient as having cellulitis and immediately admitted him to hospital because his respiratory status continued to worsen, necessitating supplemental oxygen therapy for dyspnea relief. We also considered a risk of sepsis and mortality.",

According to the patient, he had voluntarily ingested 90 pills of colchicine (1.125 mg/kg) 12 hours prior to the medical evaluation. On arrival at the ER, his physical examination did not show any relevant findings besides mild dizziness. He was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure (BP) of 131/68 mmHg, pulse of 73 beats per minute (bpm), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on room air, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15 points. The patient denied abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea, or respiratory distress. His bloodwork, however, revealed liver and kidney dysfunction. The arterial blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis and hyperlactacidemia - pH 7.47; bicarbonate (HCO3-) 19 mmol/L, and lactate 4.0 mmol/L. Laboratory results on admission are shown in Table .\\nTreatment with activated charcoal was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On arrival at the ICU, he showed increased sleepiness with a GCS of 14 points. Tympanic temperature was 37.6\u00baC. Due to his hepatic dysfunction, empirical treatment with high doses of acetylcysteine was started according to the hospital protocol for acetaminophen overdose (loading dose: 12000 mg in the first hour, 4000 mg over the next four hours, and finally 8000 mg over 16 hours). He began supplementation of oxygen through a Venturi mask with an inspired oxygen fraction of 31%. However, repeated blood gas analysis showed mild respiratory dysfunction with a partial pressure of oxygen (paO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 225, worsening metabolic acidosis with HCO3- of 16,7 but maintaining a pH 7.44 due to hyperventilation. Lactate was 5.13 mmol/L. Five hours after admission, the patient presented fever (38.8\u00baC) with polypnea - respiratory rate (RR) of 30 to 40 breaths per minute) with worsened respiratory dysfunction, which led to intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. He developed cardiac arrest (asystole) and was resuscitated after six minutes of advanced life support. Norepinephrine was started after recovery of spontaneous circulation, at 0.4 mcg/kg/min (maximum dosage given). Nine hours post-admission to the ICU, the patient developed anuria with worsening metabolic acidosis, hyperlactacidemia, and multiorgan dysfunction (respiratory, renal, hepatic, and hematologic), presenting a new episode of cardiac arrest with asystole reverted after six minutes. Renal replacement therapy with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) was initiated. A cardiac ultrasound evaluation was performed, and it revealed severe biventricular dysfunction. Empirical antibiotherapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was started due to progressive elevation of fever and elevated C-reactive protein even though no infectious cause was identified. Four hours later (13 hours post-admission in the ICU and 25 hours post-ingestion of colchicine), he again went into cardiac arrest (asystole) and advanced life support was unsuccessful. The progression of laboratory findings is shown in Table .\\nFigure depicts the clinical progression of the patient over time in the ICU, showing the progressive elevation of the lactate level (minimum of 4 mmol/L and a maximum of 16 mmol/L), as well as the three episodes of cardiac arrest.",

He was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute) and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air was 92%. The abdominal palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory tests showed a white blood count (WBC) of 8000 cells/mcL with 74% neutrophils, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 31,000/mcL), total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, AST 150 UI/L, ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR).

Computed tomography showed edema of the small intestine and bladder wall. Perforation of the appendix, alimental tract, or urinary tract was suspected; thus, emergency surgery was performed. Although there were purulent ascites, remarkable redness, and edema of both the small intestine and bladder wall throughout the lower abdominal cavity, there was no perforation of the gastrointestinal or urinary tract (). Intraoperative Gram staining of purulent ascites in the abdominal cavity showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci. Based on these findings, idiopathic peritonitis was initially suspected; thus, only irrigation and drainage were performed to complete the surgery. Although a part of the patient's left lower leg appeared slightly red in the operating room, we mistakenly assumed that the presence of mild phlegmonous changes was not associated with the abdominal cavity findings.

Upon hemodynamic stabilization, a total body computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed unstable pelvic fractures and right flank mesenteric bleeding, without clear evidence of intestinal perforation. Damage control surgery of his pelvic fractures was performed by positioning external fixators [, ]. Transfer to our unit was then planned for definitive osteosynthesis.\\nOn arrival he had fever and profuse diarrhea, leukocytosis, normal procalcitonin (PCT), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate 0.9 mmol/L, an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of 11, and a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 3; his Predisposition, Infection, Response, and Organ Dysfunction (PIRO) score was 5 []. He wore a tracheostomy and was mechanically ventilated on analgosedation; he was left on parenteral nutrition and a minimal enteral feeding was started.\\nChest X-rays detected a right basal infiltrate. Orthopedic surgery was postponed. After thorough microbiological sampling, immune chromatography for Clostridium difficile was negative, rectal swabs grew MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, whereas blood cultures yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci. His antibiotic therapy was modified as described here and in Table . As external fixators poured purulent secretions, on day 15 he underwent definitive pelvic osteosynthesis in spite of persistent fever and diarrhea (Fig. ). Septic shock ensued 24 hours after surgery, with oliguria, leukocytosis, PCT 4.39 ng/ml, CRP 46.6 mg/L, and lactate 1.17 mmol/L; his SOFA score rose to 6. After adequate fluid resuscitation, norepinephrine was added for persistent hypotension, based on data of hemodynamic monitoring (cardiac output and stroke volume variation using PiCCO Plus monitoring system) and trends of central venous saturation of oxygen (ScVO2). Low doses of steroids were prescribed for the first 3 days. Microbiological sampling included blood cultures, quantitative culture of tracheal secretions, and culture of urine []. Blood cultures were negative; urine and tracheal aspirate samples were positive for CRKP and MDR A. baumannii.\\nHe had a short-lasting improvement, with fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting relapsing after a few days; a repeated CT scan of his abdomen revealed suprapubic and left ischiatic abscesses at surgical sites, as well as dilated bowel due to paralytic ileus.

On arrival, he was fully conscious and complained of facial pain. Clinical examination showed facial swelling, persistent intraoral and nasal hemorrhage, and bloody otorrhea from the left ear. He showed gross malocclusion associated with discontinuity and mobilization of the maxillary and mandibular dentitions. He had no significant medical history and had been healthy before the accident. Computed tomography (CT) and plain radiography revealed right pulmonary contusion, fractures of a second rib and the right radius, and airway narrowing. In the maxillofacial region, bilateral condylar and mandibular fractures, LeFort II-type fracture, and blow-out fracture of the orbit were recognized (). Airway control was achieved by awake orotracheal intubation. Hemostasis was performed by suture compression for oral hemorrhage and by gauze tamponade for nasal hemorrhage under local anesthesia, although nasal hemostasis proved extremely difficult to achieve. Respiratory management with a ventilator was conducted under intravenous sedation until general condition was stable. After another 2 days, the tracheal tube was removed, because no airway narrowing or obstruction was evident. Six days after the accident, tracheotomy and repositioning and fixation of the fractured facial bones, including the mandible, maxilla, zygoma, and blow-out fracture of the orbit, were performed under general anesthesia (). Surgery lasted 7 h 16 min, with 30 mL of intraoperative bleeding. Intraoperatively, the patient received blood transfusion of 2 units of red blood cell concentrate due to low hemoglobin levels (7.3 g/dL). The postoperative course was uneventful. On postoperative day 5, however, fever over 39.0\u00b0C and shivering were noted. Laboratory examination showed increases in the white blood cell count to 14,060/\u03bcL and C-reactive protein (CRP) to 12.1 mg/dL and a decrease in platelets to 131 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (down from 238 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL at the time of the accident). CT revealed no abnormalities other than those at the surgical sites. The next day, the patient showed preshock status with a significant decrease in blood pressure, fever over 39.0\u00b0C, and transient loss of consciousness. Emergency laboratory tests showed increases in CRP to 23.9 mg/dL, TBIL to 2.1 mg/dL, creatinine to 0.97 mg/dL, lactate to 4.07 mmol/L, prothrombin time to 21.7 s, FDP (fibrin degradation product) to 10.8 \u03bcg/mL, and PT-INR (prothrombin time-international normalized ratio) to 1.86, along with a decrease in platelets to 46 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (). The bacteria was not detected in several tests of blood culture. In the evaluation of respiratory system, PaO2 was 68.2 mmHg, PaCO2 was 28.2 mmHg in blood gas analysis, and PaO2/FiO2 was 341. In circulatory dynamics, noradrenaline was administered sustainably by 0.04\u0264 for keeping of blood pressure.

She had no significant past medical history.\\nThe patient tested positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) on July 17th. In the previous facility, the patient was initially placed on the face mask and was upgraded to a high-flow nasal cannula. However, the patient soon desaturated and experienced respiratory arrest. Therefore, the patient was intubated for a couple of days and then transferred to our facility. Prior to admission, she was initially administered ceftriaxone 1 g and azithromycin 500 mg, IV daily. After intubation, she was started on dexamethasone, remdesivir, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and mechanical ventilation were to be continued in the following days. She was therefore transported to our facility via an air ambulance and admitted to the ICU. Her qSOFA (quick sequential organ failure assessment) score was 2 (considered high-risk), SOFA was 8 points, mortality thought to be <33%, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) suggested 30% estimated postoperative mortality. After an extensive review of all her labs and reports, the patient was attributed to be at a high risk for acute decompensation (or catastrophically ill) thus requiring critical care management.\\nOn July 26th, she developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). On July 27th, the patient started developing signs of kidney failure with a drop in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to 19.

Even with continuous nasal high flow oxygen therapy, arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.44, PO2 of 71.0 mmHg, PCO2 of 38 mmHg, oxygenation index of 87.6, and lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L. Coagulation tests demonstrated prothrombin time of 13.7 s, prothrombin activity of 95%, and fibrinogen 5.0 g/L. Serology for respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus) as well as bacteriological assays (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Legionella) were all negative. Tests for cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, Toxoplasma, rubella virus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses, dengue virus, malaria, Leptospira, and scrub typhus were also negative. Cryptococcal antigen was negative. The galactomannan and \u03b2-D-glucan tests were both negative. The interferon-gamma release assay was indeterminate. Peripheral blood culture was negative. However, the sputum smear sample was positive for acid-fast bacilli. All the indicators were negative for routine laboratory screening (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibody, and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, et al) for autoimmune diseases. Coombs test was negative (The detailed immunological profile was shown in ). The counts of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocytes in blood were 520/mm3, 208/mm3 and 284/mm3 respectively, with a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.73. After admission, a lumbar puncture showed no abnormalities. There was no evidence in cytology and biochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid supporting the existence of tuberculous meningitis. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse infiltration and patchy shadows in both lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (). Abdominal CT revealed splenomegaly but showed no peritonitis and seroperitoneum.\\nAfter admission, the patient was initially administered with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT), and a low dose of methylprednisolone (40 mg qd intravenous infusion). The details of ATT were isoniazid (0.8 g qd intravenous infusion), rifampin (0.4 g qd orally), ethambutol (0.75 g qd orally), pyrazinamide (0.5 g TID orally) and moxifloxacin (0.4 g qd intravenous infusion). However, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated rapidly with high fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pancytopenia, and hyperferritinemia on day 3. The patient was treated with tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Metagenome next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) identified 926 of 225958 DNA sequence reads and 195 of 491668 RNA sequence reads corresponding to M. tuberculosis complex, respectively. mNGS of blood identified 48 of 125859 DNA sequence reads corresponding to M. tuberculosis. There was no sequence read corresponding to other potential pathogens (Methods, quality control and detailed results of mNGS were shown in ). Bone marrow smears showed increased macrophage activity with hemophagocytosis without evidence of leukemia or lymphoma. And there was no evidence of M. tuberculosis in bone marrow (). Additional blood tests showed hyperferritinemia (6649 ng/mL, normal range 10-291 ng/mL), low NK cell activity (13.08%, normal value: \u226515.1%, tested by flow cytometry) and elevated soluble CD25 levels (5730 pg/mL, normal value: <2400 pg/mL, tested by ELISA). Genetic testing for primary HLH was negative (Detailed result of genetic testing was shown in ). As the embryo died on day 5, she underwent a medical abortion, and caseating tuberculous granulomas were found in the placenta (). Clinical laboratory tests and imaging were performed by the department of laboratory and image center of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, respectively. mNGS, NK cell activity, level of soluble CD25 and genetic testing for primary HLH were performed and reported by Guangzhou Kingmed Medical Test Center Co., Ltd.\\nAt the most severe moment, the patient was assessed with an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score of 32, Marshall score of 14 and mortality risk of 85.3%.",

Her audiogram revealed profound and severe sensorineural hearing loss of the right and left ears, respectively (Fig. ). Since she had been febrile, malaise and anorexic for approximately a week, she was referred to the internal medicine division. Her past medical history was significant for an approximate 5-year post-operative history of breast cancer. She had been taking oral tamoxifen citrate (20 mg/day) after the surgery. Her Glasgow Coma Scale rating was E2V5M6. No abnormalities were found in her physical and neurological findings including the following: height, 159.0 cm; body weight, 43.0 kg; body mass index, 17.0 kg/m2; heart rate, 90 beats/min with regularity; body temperature, 36.4\u00b0C; except for blood pressure, 77/42 mmHg (\u2193); oxygen saturation in room air, 90% (\u2193); and respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min (\u2191).\\nBaseline laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count, 21 700/\u03bcl (\u2191); haemoglobin, 12.5 g/dl; platelet count, 3.0 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl (\u2193); blood urea nitrogen, 38 mg/dl (\u2191); creatinine, 1.34 mg/dl (\u2191); sodium, 143 mEq/l; potassium, 3.8 mEq/l; chlorides, 105 mEq/l; total protein, 5.9 g/dl (\u2193); albumin, 2.9 g/dl (\u2193); C-reactive protein, 19.06 mg/dl (\u2191); procalcitonin, 7.47 ng/ml (\u2191); total bilirubin, 0.95 mg/dl; direct bilirubin, 0.57 mg/dl (\u2191); aspartate aminotransferase, 52 IU/l (\u2191); alanine aminotransferase, 50 IU/l (\u2191); lactate dehydrogenase, 396 IU/l (\u2191); alkaline phosphatase, 488 IU/l (\u2191); cholinesterase, 135 IU/l (\u2193); \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, 142 IU/l (\u2191); and glucose, 142 mg/dl (\u2191).

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia (101 beats/min) and an incomplete right bundle branch block. Chest X-ray revealed consolidation of both lower lung fields with air bronchogram and a reticular pattern (Fig. a). These findings suggested that the patient suffered from sepsis, specifically septic shock (quick sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score, 3 points).\\nOn the day of admission (Day 1), her respiratory failure was rapidly exaggerated following administration of ceftriaxone sodium hydrate (2 g q24hr), which was initiated immediately after taking 2 sets of blood cultures (Fig. b). On Day 2, platelet transfusion was performed because the platelet count decreased to 1.4 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl, and subcutaneous and oral bleeding as well as blood-stained sputum were present due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and intravenous noradrenaline were further administered for congestive heart failure and low blood pressure, respectively. Finally, mechanical ventilation was performed after intubation on Day 3, but her condition turned out to be acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FIO2 ratio was 184.8) caused by septic shock and congestive heart failure.",

The review of systems was negative for any fever, chills, chest pain, palpitations, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, hematochezia or melena, dysuria, polyuria, polydipsia, tremors, heat or cold intolerance. No history of trauma or apparent blood loss was evident. He reported being on immunotherapy with nivolumab for his metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He had been on nivolumab for the last six months, and the current symptoms started after his last dose, which was two weeks ago.\\nThe patient's initial blood pressure (BP) in the doctor's office was noted to be 78/44 mmHg, so he was referred to the emergency department (ED). On arrival in the ED, his BP was 96/50 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 72 beats per minute, and body temperature 97.3\u00b0 F. He received several liters of intravenous (IV) fluid boluses; however, BP consistently stayed in 90s systolic and 40-50 diastolic. His physical exam was significant for known chronic bilateral lower extremity pitting edema; heart sounds were heard normal S1, S2 with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or rubs or gallops, no jugular venous distension. Lung sounds were heard clear, normal vesicular breath sounds were bilateral, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. The skin was warm to touch, with no rashes or open wounds. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, no visible or palpable organomegaly, bowel sounds were heard normal. The lab investigations (Table ) was significant for a white blood cell count (WBC) of 4.0 u/L (normal 4.8-10.8 x 10*3/uL), low sodium (Na) level at 128 mmol/L (decreased from his baseline of 133-139 mmol/L, normal 135-146 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) elevated at 37 mg/dL (normal 10-20 mg/dL), creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL (elevated from his baseline of 1.1-1.4 mg/dL, normal 0.6-1.1 mg/dL). His troponins were not detectable. EKG did not reveal any ST - T segment changes suggestive of new ischemic changes. He was initially started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics in view of possible sepsis. Antibiotics were eventually discontinued since there were no evident sources of infection and a lack of fever or leucocytosis, making sepsis as the cause for hypotension less likely.

She had no significant past medical history.\\nThe patient tested positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) on July 17th. In the previous facility, the patient was initially placed on the face mask and was upgraded to a high-flow nasal cannula. However, the patient soon desaturated and experienced respiratory arrest. Therefore, the patient was intubated for a couple of days and then transferred to our facility. Prior to admission, she was initially administered ceftriaxone 1 g and azithromycin 500 mg, IV daily. After intubation, she was started on dexamethasone, remdesivir, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and mechanical ventilation were to be continued in the following days. She was therefore transported to our facility via an air ambulance and admitted to the ICU. Her qSOFA (quick sequential organ failure assessment) score was 2 (considered high-risk), SOFA was 8 points, mortality thought to be <33%, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) suggested 30% estimated postoperative mortality. After an extensive review of all her labs and reports, the patient was attributed to be at a high risk for acute decompensation (or catastrophically ill) thus requiring critical care management.\\nOn July 26th, she developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). On July 27th, the patient started developing signs of kidney failure with a drop in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to 19. She also desaturated several times that night but her saturation returned to 99% the following morning. On July 31st, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and her labs showed a drop in hemoglobin levels from 9.2 to 7.2. The patient was able to recover with appropriate treatment, however, she subsequently developed respiratory failure the following day with an oxygen saturation of 51% while remaining anuric. Her SOFA score at this time correlated to more than 90% mortality. Appropriate measures were taken and her saturation improved to 90%. Her clinical course kept deteriorating with further episodes of respiratory failure and two episodes of cardiac arrest on August 3rd to 6th. Finally, on August 8th, the patient suffered another cardiac arrest and developed pulseless electrical activity; however, attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful and therefore the patient died.\\nImaging and laboratory tests\\nOn July 25th, the patient underwent a chest X-ray that showed bilateral patchy opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure ).

The patient denied any previous personal or family history of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events or any additional risk factors for VTE. Routine tests included electrocardiogram (sinus tachycardia with negative T waves V2-V4), chest X-ray (normal findings), arterial blood gas (pO2 59 mmHg, pCO2 32 mmHg, normal pH and bicarbonate level). High-sensitivity troponin T was 52 ng/mL (normal range: <14 ng/mL) and NT-proBNP was 610 pg/mL (normal reference range <100 pg/dL).",

        "note": "An 82-year-old female, with a history of hypertension for the past 10 years; and on amlodipine, presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sharp right upper quadrant pain for 1 day. The pain was of sudden onset, and progressively worsened, not associated with nausea or vomiting, or any changes in bowel habits. Her vital signs were: blood pressure of 144/89 mmHg, pulse rate of 66 beats/min, body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius; respiratory rate of 19 breaths/min and was saturating at 99% in room air. During physical examination, she was in agonizing pain, afebrile, not pale and not icteric. She had severe tenderness on the right hypochondriac region extending to the epigastric region, with Murphy\u2019s sign positive and positive rebound tenderness indicating local peritonitis. At the ED, the patient was given tramadol to control the pain, and intravenous antibiotics were initiated. Chest X-ray, electrocardiography and other parameters were within normal range. Blood workup was done and showed a raised alanine aminotransferase of 50.30 U/L, (2.00\u201341.00). An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a shrunken gallbladder with increased wall thickness-5 mm in size, and an impression of cholecystitis was made. A few hours post admission, the rebound tenderness was lost and hence an abdominal CT scan was ordered, for a confirmatory diagnosis. The abdominal CT scan reported diffuse thickening of the gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid collection. Perforation of the gallbladder was noted, with contained fluid collection around the transverse colon (hepatic flexure). No gallbladder calculus or mass was seen. Features were suggestive of perforated cholecystitis (). The patient was planned for an open cholecystectomy; the abdomen was then entered via a right Kocher\u2019s incision. The gallbladder was identified and a concealed perforation was seen at the upper body, pulling the epiploic appendages of the transverse colon (). The appendages were released and a retrograde cholecystectomy was done. Hemostasis was achieved and the abdomen was closed in layers. Post-operative antibiotics and analgesics were given.\\nIn the ward, 6 hours post-operatively, the patient had stable hemodynamic measurements but suddenly she started experiencing an onset of difficulty in breathing. Upon examination, she had a respiratory rate of 27 breaths/min, de-saturating at 75% in room air. She increasingly became hypotensive over time with a blood pressure of 75/50 mmHg, and had a tachycardia of 110 beats/min.",

        "note": "This case reports on an athletic 40-year-old Asian female who presented with the chief complaint of left-sided headache with radiation to the left eye, jaw, and shoulder for two consecutive days. Importantly, approximately two weeks prior to hospitalization and symptomatic headache, she completed a full-length marathon without any problem or incident. She had trained for this event beforehand and exercises regularly. She is a 5\u20193\u201d, 49.75 kg athlete with a body mass index (BMI) of 19.43 kg/m2. The patient reports moderate severity of her headache, describes the pain as significant pressure and reports that Tylenol, Advil, and Midol were all ineffective for symptom relief. Though Advil typically relieves any headaches she has experienced prior to the current incident, none of the over-the-counter interventions proved to be effective for this event. She denies cognitive deficit, language disturbances, problems with vision, or previous history of migraines. Neurological examination demonstrated cranial nerve 2-12 fully intact, sharp discs bilaterally on fundoscopic examination, and equal 5/5 motor strength on bilateral upper and lower extremities for both proximal and distal flexion, extension, and grip strength. There is no obvious ataxia present with finger-to-nose or heel-to-shin testing. Biceps, brachialis, and patellar reflexes are equal bilaterally. No leg swelling or pain was noticed or reported at the time of examination. History and physical exam indicated both MRI and CT venogram of the brain with and without contrast. MRI and CT demonstrated nonocclusive mild dural venous sinus thrombosis within torcula and straight sinus, as well as nonocclusive superior sagittal sinus, rounded filling defect suggesting possible dural sinus thrombosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial infarct or abnormal intracranial enhancement, but there was evidence of this disruption of normal flow and filling defects in superior sagittal sinus measuring up to 7 mm in size on MRI and to 8.8 mm on CT. MRI and CT imaging demonstrating a sagittal sinus filling defect in Figure and Figure , respectively.\\nAt this time, a diagnosis of dural venous thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state was made, and she was admitted to an inpatient unit. She denies any history of blood clots and leg-specific clots. For completion of her workup for other thrombotic events, ultrasound-based vascular Doppler of the bilateral lower extremity venous system was done, which found one area of occlusive thrombosis within the right calf peroneal vein distribution, as seen in Figure . All remaining venous systems bilaterally were patent and without evidence of a second DVT. A chest CT angiogram was done, which showed no pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, or focal pneumonia.\\nMedical history is significant for Lynch syndrome with status post colon cancer diagnosed while eight months pregnant, as well as status post nonmalignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Her CEA was 60.5 at the time of diagnosis, thus indicating colon cancer as normal limits are <2.5 in nonsmokers like this patient. She had T4aN0G3 disease, which falls into Stage IIB for prognostic staging. This classification indicates tumor invading through the visceral peritoneum with associated gross perforation of bowel through the tumor, no positive lymph nodes, and no metastasis []. This was treated with both surgery and FOLFOX chemotherapy, which includes leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin. She reached remission and had her last treatment six months prior to this event. The patient takes the contraceptive Yaz to suppress ovulation and reduce the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer. She is at increased risk for endometrial malignancies, gastric, duodenal, and urothelial cancers due to Lynch syndrome diagnosis []. Surgical history includes pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) resection and large intestine reconstruction. She does not drink alcohol and has no present or historical use of illicit drugs or tobacco products. Thus, her medical history shows possible hypercoagulability from cancer history, as well as the use of Yaz, both of which predispose her to thrombus formation.\\nLabs were ordered numerous times throughout her hospital stay, including a thrombotic risk panel consisting of Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, antithrombin, protein C and S, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-glycoprotein antibodies. All results of this thrombotic risk panel were reportedly negative. Other significant findings are as follows. Leukocytosis was found at admission likely due to thrombus-related damage to venous structures, which can lead to systemic inflammatory symptoms such as leukocytosis []. Leukocytosis was also found again later in admission, which was expected to be reactive in nature from steroid therapy she was given later in the hospital stay. She presented with thrombocytosis at 418 x103/uL on admission as well. Research by Monreal et al. has indicated that this can often be a significant indicator for a lack of pulmonary embolism (PE) in those with venous thrombosis/thromboembolism, which was indeed true for this patient, as her thromboembolism was a dural venous sinus and leg DVT, while evidence of PE was ruled out []. Although high hematocrit, hemoglobin, and RBC levels are often associated with increased risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism, her hematocrit was 34.7%, just below the 36% lower limit of normal in women, hemoglobin was 11.5, again just barely below the lower limit of normal in women, and RBC of 4.26 million/mcL, which is within the normal range []. Thus, these particular lab findings did not demonstrate an increased risk for her chances of developing DVT. PT/INR and PTT were all found within normal limits at admission, though these values did change in accordance with medical treatments including heparin and warfarin, which would be expected to alter partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), respectively. By the time of discharge, INR was 1.7, PT was 19.9 seconds, and PTT was 29.2 seconds thus demonstrating findings just below the 2-3 Warfarin discharge goal, elevated, and within normal limits, respectively. Finally, a D-dimer was not ordered, due to lack of specificity for DVT, and therefore its interpretation cannot be reported.\\nHer thrombotic risk overall during this particular event includes her recent cancer history and use of contraceptive, Yaz. In addition to these, it is important to include the risks to which she was exposed as an endurance runner, including hemoconcentration, the potential for dehydration, muscular injury, and subsequent systemic inflammation [].",

The pain was described as being dull in nature, nonradiating, exacerbated by deep inspiration, and 8/10 in severity on the numeric rating scale. He also mentioned having a progressive and persistent nonproductive cough of the same duration. These symptoms began three weeks after he returned from a one-month vacation in West Africa.\\nOn presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 100.8 F, his heart rate was 108 beats per minute and he had tachypnea of 25 breaths per minute. Physical examination of the abdomen was significant for a persistent diffuse abdominal pain, most pronounced in the right hypochondrium, which hindered effective palpation of the liver borders. Exam of the thorax was significant for rapid shallow breathing with resultant decreased breath sounds diffusely, most pronounced over the right lung base. Hematological investigation was significant for a WBC of 30,500/\u03bcL (4500\u201311000/\u03bcL) with 80% polymorphonuclear leukocyte count (57\u201367%). AST/ALT was mildly elevated at 70/51 U/L (7\u201340 U/L) with an albumin of 2.7 g/dL (3.5\u20135.5 g/dL) and mildly elevated prothrombin time and INR of 15.4 s (11\u201315 s) and 1.42 s (0.8\u20131.2 s), respectively. Additionally, his PTT was also elevated at 36.7 s (20\u201335 s) and his D-dimer was elevated at 5.7 mg/L (0.2\u20130.7 mg/L). Of note, the bilirubin and creatinine were within normal limits.\\nDue to positive D-dimer, tachypnea, tachycardia, and high suspicion of pulmonary embolism, given recent long distance travel, CT scans of the chest and abdomen with contrast were done.",

The patient complained of pain, swelling and bleeding in the left upper limb for 2 h.\\nThe patient had a motorcycle accident on August 28, 2013. The left little finger landed first, then the left wrist flexed and landed and the dorsal skin of the left forearm was punctured by ulna and radius fractures causing pain, swelling and bleeding of the left upper limb. The skin of the left hand felt normal after the trauma, and finger activity was normal. He was sent to our hospital for emergency treatment for debridement, and his left arm was fixed with long arm plaster. The X-ray radiography showed fractures of the left distal ulna, radius and little finger as well as wrist joint dislocation (Figure ). The injury occurred only in the left upper limb, and no other organs or tissues were injured.\\nThe patient was hospitalized for further surgical treatment. External fixation and Kirschner wire were used to stabilize the left distal ulna, radius and little finger (Figure ). The patient walked every day after the operation. The swelling of the left forearm was reduced 12 d after the first surgery. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed under general anesthesia to stabilize the left distal ulna and radius. Because some of the bone in the distal radius was lost due to compression, we took about 10 g of bone from the left ilium to fill (Figure ). The operation continued for 4 h. Broad-spectrum antibiotic was used to prevent infection, and drugs were used to promote blood flow and microcirculation. After the anesthesia recovery period, the patient told us that he suffered severe pain and could hear the noise from the electric drill during the operation, but he was unable to communicate this during the operation. This led to psychological trauma. The patient became very sensitive to pain and remained in bed until the third postoperative day.\\nOn the third postoperative morning, when he got out of bed and was going to the toilet, he was unable to stand, owing to double lower limb weakness and pain. The double lower limbs were not tumid, and the skin color was normal. When he received a shot for the intravenous infusion, he was very nervous and suddenly felt chest pain and asthma and had breathing difficulty. Additionally, his double lung breaths sounded thick and had a large number of dry and wet rales. The partial pressure of arterious blood oxygen was 7.2 kPa (normal range 11-13 kPa), arterial oxygen saturation was 88.8% (normal range 91.9%-99.0%), and central venous pressure was 11 cmH2O (normal range 5-10 cmH2O). After oxygen therapy, peripheral capillary hemoglobin oxygen saturation was 92%, blood pressure was 158/110 mmHg, heart rate was 110 bpm, and respiratory rate was 30 bpm. The brain natriuretic peptide troponin I was negative. The serum D-dimer level was 17.48 \u03bcg/mL. The bedside electrocardiograph showed sinus tachycardia.",

She was regularly treated with acenocoumarol 4 mg daily. She admitted being compliant to treatment but was not regularly checked for efficacy of anticoagulation. She stopped using intramuscular contraceptive about 10 months ago. She reported two spontaneous abortions before the twelfth week of gestation when she was aged eighteen. She has been experiencing menstrual bleeding since 9 days. She denied tobacco use, and consumed alcohol occasionally. She denied any chronic disease.\\nOn examination, she was not acutely ill-looking and in no acute distress. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute. Her respiratory rate was 32 cycles per minute, and her oxygen saturation was 91% on room air. She was markedly obese.

There were no clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis nor signs of right ventricular failure. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable. The diagnosis of probable recurrence of pulmonary embolism was made based on intermediate pretest clinical probability (modified Geneva score of 8). A contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary scan showed multiple proximal and segmental filling defects of the right pulmonary arteries. ECG showed regular sinus tachycardia, with inverted T-waves in lead V1\u2013V4, D2, aVF, and D3 (Fig. ). Echocardiography showed markedly dilated right heart chambers with mass effect on the left chambers, a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 85 mmHg, and normal aortic valves (Fig. ).

        "note": "We present a case of a 46-year-old Asian woman who was usually fit and well except for a 1-year history of menorrhagia prior to her initial presentation in our emergency department (ED). Her menorrhagia was due to multiple fibroids diagnosed via transvaginal ultrasound of the pelvis in 2018, which showed a multifibroid uterus with normal-appearing ovaries and no obvious adnexal cysts/masses. She was then started on TXA (1 g three times daily as required) and mefenamic acid (500 mg three times daily as required) to be taken during her menstrual period to reduce excessive bleeding and pain, respectively. She claimed she did not have to take the TXA (and mefenamic acid) during all her menstrual periods, because she believed the TXA was not required on many occasions. She was physically healthy, of normal weight (body mass index of 22 kg/m2), never smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol, and had no previous history of DVT or PE. She also denied using any form of contraception and had no significant family history of clotting disorders or cancer, but she claimed her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had died of myocardial infarction.\\nOur patient presented to our ED with a 2-week history of noncardiac-type central chest pain that was nonradiating, pleuritic, and intermittent with occasional shortness of breath on exertion. She had no history of diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, cough, fever, or any infective symptoms. She had no history of recent long-distance journey or any other significant risk factors suggestive of VTE.\\nExcept for a fast heart rate (119 beats/minute), her vital signs, including blood pressure and physical examination, were within normal limits. Her chest x-ray was normal, and her Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no dynamic changes except for sinus tachycardia. Her D-dimer was marginally raised at 0.66 \u03bcg/ml (normal range, 0.05 to 0.50 \u03bcg/ml), whereas her cardiac troponin I finding was negative. Other routine blood test results, including electrolytes, complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and clotting screen, were within normal limits. She was diagnosed with possible anxiety/musculoskeletal pain and sent home with analgesics and a planned follow-up review of her symptoms in the emergency ambulatory clinic (EAC) after 1 week.\\nAbout 2 weeks after her initial presentation, the patient came back for follow-up review in the EAC as planned. She claimed she still experienced pleuritic chest pain on and off in addition to a new intermittent interscapular pain. A repeat D-dimer test result came back negative (0.35 \u03bcg/ml; normal range, 0.05 to 0.50 \u03bcg/ml). Likewise, results of her physical examination and recheck of her routine blood tests, including troponin I, clotting screen, and inflammatory markers, were all within normal limits. She was reassured and discharged to home after a (repeat) normal chest x-ray finding. She was informed that a computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) or ventilation/perfusion measurement was not required.\\nAbout 2 months after the follow-up review, our patient re-presented to our ED with symptoms of pleuritic central chest pain and intermittent shortness of breath on moderate exertion. She claimed her symptoms were similar to her previous presentations. Further history was taken to exclude infection, cardiac-related problems, and common risk factors for PE, among other illnesses, but the findings were unremarkable.

Two years prior, he had been struck by a motor vehicle and fractured his first lumbar vertebra. This fracture was treated with an L1 corpectomy and an instrumented fusion from T12 to L2. This complication coupled with the diagnosis of cancer, as outlined below, resulted in the patient being treated almost ever since with transdermal fentanyl for a chronic pain syndrome.\\nA few months earlier, a hematologic evaluation for leukocytosis had led to the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis with an associated clonal hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 1 (CMML-1). The patient was subsequently found to have leukemia cutis and eosinophilic myocarditis. Symptoms of pruritus and dyspnea improved with high-dose steroids and hydroxycarbamide. The steroids were tapered slowly over months, and the patient started azacytidine in place of hydroxycarbamide to treat his CMML-1. However, during this evaluation process and treatment for mastocytosis and CMML-1, the patient remained on a fentanyl patch (100-\u03bcg/h patch every 72 h). He had no history of a psychiatric disorder, but he had experimented with psychotropic substances in his youth and had a flat affect at baseline.\\nWhen the patient presented for his second cycle of azacytidine, he appeared despondent and described shortness of breath. He provided limited answers to questions, with poor eye contact throughout the interview. An accompanying friend reported that the patient had been less communicative over the preceding 4 days and had complained of shortness of breath. The patient's heart rate was 96 beats/min, blood pressure 116/77 mm Hg, SpO2 94%, temperature 37.0\u00b0C, and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. The circumference of the left leg was 5 cm greater than that of his right leg, and his lungs were clear to auscultation.

No history of recent travel, trauma, immobilization, or surgery. No history of DVT in the past. He was not compliant with his medications that included Lisinopril and atorvastatin. His physical examination showed swelling of the right LE with erythema, edema, tenderness, and positive Homans\u2019 sign. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries pulses were +3 bilaterally. No cyanosis or blanching of the lower extremities. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. His basic laboratory workup including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR), and the comprehensive metabolic panel was normal (). His LE venous Doppler showed acute DVT from the proximal right superficial femoral vein through the popliteal vein and involving the calf veins. The patient was given analgesics orally, but his pain did not subside so he was started on intravenous (IV) analgesics. The patient was admitted to the telemetry floor after he was started on a heparin drip with a bolus for full anticoagulation. Hypercoagulable state workups were sent. With his history of RCC, the patient had a computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast to rule out any masses/cancers as an underlying possible provoked cause of his acute DVT, but all came back negative. No incidental PE was seen in the CT chest (). The patient was thought to have a high-risk DVT due to its extension, so the plan was to treat him with parenteral anticoagulation for 5 to 7 days and then switch to direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC). On day 5, the patient had an episode of syncope for 2 minutes when he was standing up from his bed. His vitals at that time were the following: blood pressure 121/67 mm Hg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 96% on room air. Orthostatic vitals were negative. His electrocardiography (EKG) and telemetry did not show any arrhythmia. It was thought that the patient had a vasovagal reflex syncope. The patient was continued on heparin drip with an activated PTT (aPTT) 1.5 times the control all the time (). In a few minutes after his syncopal episode, the patient became hypoxic, tachypneic, and tachycardic. His repeated blood pressure was 128/75 mm Hg. His chest X-ray showed clear lungs.

Her history comprised of atraumatic pain without any signs or symptoms of infection and without any subjective weight loss or systemic features. She was an ex-smoker for 16 years. She had attended her general practitioner (GP) multiple times for the same pain over the preceding month. The GP organised an MRI of the left knee which was performed eight days before presentation to the ED. The MRI revealed a subcutaneous fat collection at the level of the left tibial tuberosity with no bony or ligamentous injury. Concerned about her symptoms, the patient attended a private orthopaedic consultant who, considering the MRI results, discharged her with simple analgesia. She subsequently decided to present to the ED for further clinical input due to worsening pain.\\nOn examination, her vital signs were normal. Systemically, she seemed well without any further symptoms. A focused examination of the left lower leg revealed mild erythema of the medial aspect of the proximal tibia without any swelling, bruising, or deformity. She had point tenderness over the medial aspect of the proximal tibia. Her gait was normal, and she had a good range of motion in her knee and ankle joint. Neurovascular examination of the lower limb was normal. No knee tenderness was elicited. The initial differential diagnoses considered were musculoskeletal pain/injury, stress fracture, gastrocnemius muscle tear/tightness, or fibromyalgia. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a common cause of lower limb pain was out ruled by a D-dimer value of 0.29 mcg/mL (normal: < 0.44 mcg/mL).",

He experienced an acute onset of shortness of breath that started a couple of days prior to his presentation. He was working in his back yard and suddenly became dizzy and felt like he could not catch his breath. He attributed this episode to an anxiety attack due to ongoing stress factors. He endorsed some level of stress due to a bout of persistent diarrhea he had been experiencing for one month. The diarrhea started off with a few soft bowel movements per day and increased to up to six or seven bowel movements daily. The bowel movements were watery, without blood or mucus. These episodes of diarrhea were associated with mild, dull abdominal aches, and progressive abdominal distension. He also reported a 40-pound weight loss in the past year which he attributed to dietary changes that he had made for his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He also endorsed a decreased appetite for four weeks. In addition, two weeks ago, he noticed swelling in his right calf and thigh, followed by the swelling of his left leg.\\nHe was hypotensive on arrival at the emergency department with low blood pressure (BP) and a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the 50s (mmHg) and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute (bpm). He was alert and oriented times four. Pertinent physical examination findings were of lower extremity swelling up to the mid-thigh level (pitting). Distended, non-tender abdomen with fluid thrills were suggestive of ascites. Further abdominal exam revealed a 5 x 4 cm palpable umbilical nodule which was purplish, non-tender and suggestive of possible SMJN (Figure ).
