From the age of 4 years, her parents had noticed abnormalities of her teeth. She is the 5th of the six siblings born to native Kashmiri consanguineous (first cousins) parents. Her younger brother had died at the age of 4 years, and he had presented with hypokalemic quadriparesis. Examination revealed prepubertal girl with severe, proportionate short stature (height 117 cm, height standard deviation [SD] score − 5.32). Her weight was 27 kg (weight SD score − 1.76). There were no clinical features of rickets. Oral examination revealed generalized pitting, yellowish-brown pigmentation of all the surfaces of the teeth, delayed exfoliation of deciduous teeth, and delayed eruption of permanent teeth []. Detailed ophthalmic examination and pure-tone audiometry were normal. Radiographically, the radiodense enamel was absent in all the teeth with normal radiodensity of dentin, large, and open pulp canals. Few retained deciduous teeth and impacted canines and premolars were seen. The clinical and radiographic features led to the diagnosis of hypoplastic AI.\nInvestigations revealed a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (serial serum pH 7.19, 7.20, and 7.22 and anion gap 11, 14, and 15), alkaline urine (serial urine pH 6.7, 6.5, and 7), and hypokalemia (serial serum K+ 1.85, 1.52, and 2.8 mEq/L).

495,Which of the following is the correct clinical calculator to use?,"A 33-year-old Caucasian man developed heart failure after myocardial infarction in 1996. In 2003, he had a septic shock with acute tubular necrosis treated by continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH). Renal function recovered to an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (normal value >60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Despite revascularization and cardiac resynchronization therapy, he developed heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV in 2013. He was rejected for a heart transplant because of his impaired renal function (eGFR 22 mL/min/1.73 m2). A combined heart–kidney transplant is not performed in the Netherlands. During LVAD screening, ultrasonography showed normal kidney sizes with diffuse loss of renal cortex but no focal parenchymal degeneration or hydronephrosis. As on inotropes and temporary mechanical support with an Impella® (ABIOMED Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) renal function improved to an eGFR of 39 mL/min/1.73 m2, we hypothesized that renal function could partly recover after optimization of haemodynamics with an LVAD.

232,Which of the following is the correct clinical calculator to use?,"A 62-year-old Caucasian male with a history of successfully treated hepatitis C presented with diffuse abdominal pain. Workup with ultrasound and follow-up multiphase abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a heterogeneously enhancing and infiltrative liver mass measuring approximately 10 x 9 x 13 cm involving segments five through eight suspicious for a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with right portal vein tumor thrombus extending to the main portal vein through Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS 5V tumor). The appearance of the tumor was complicated by prominent perfusion anomalies within segments five and eight. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen confirmed these findings (Figure ), and the chest CT was negative for metastatic disease. Initial alpha-feta protein (AFP) was significantly elevated at 24,976.\nNo targetable lesion was seen on ultrasound due to the infiltrative nature of the lesion and CT-guided biopsy was performed but was nondiagnostic (fibrotic benign liver tissue). Despite the lack of tissue confirmation, the consensus of the multidisciplinary liver tumor board was to treat the patient for HCC, given the radiographic appearance, gross vascular invasion and elevated AFP in the setting of underlying hepatitis C and cirrhosis. The treatment with sorafenib 400 mg PO twice daily was recommended, which was complicated by severe fatigue, anorexia, and hyponatremia necessitating hospitalization. Sorafenib was restarted at 50% dose reduction after recovery from his hospitalization. Definitive external beam radiation therapy with hypofractionated proton beam therapy was recommended given the concern for the patient’s intolerance of sorafenib tolerance and the potential reduced tumor efficacy of continuing sorafenib at reduced doses. Proton therapy was chosen to limit the dose to the uninvolved normal liver and surrounding gastrointestinal organs considering the high tumor with the normal liver volume ratio. His pre-radiation AFP peaked at 37,200.\nSince fiducial markers were not able to be placed (tumor was not visible on ultrasound) for tumor motion assessment or image guidance, the patient was CT simulated in the supine position with both arms abducted above the head using the Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC)™ breath hold system (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden) in the end-exhale position at 20% of the maximal deep inhalation volume. Multiple phases (non-contrast, arterial, venous, and delayed) scans were acquired. Considering the challenges in contouring the gross tumor volume (GTV) posed by the infiltrative nature of the tumor and perfusion abnormalities on imaging, a technetium-99m [99mTc] sulfur colloid single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scan was registered to the treatment planning CT and utilized to assist in the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) as previously published by our group [-] (Figure ).\nMargins of 5 mm were added to the GTV to create a clinical target volume (CTV) and account for tumor margin uncertainties. The CTV was also extended 10 mm medial to the furthest extent of the main portal vein tumor thrombus to account for the proximal microscopic extension. Nonisotropic margins of 5 mm radially and 8 mm superiorly/inferiorly were then applied to the CTV and GTV to generate planning target volumes (PTV1 and PTV2, respectively).\nIntensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) with a pencil beam scanning (PBS) was utilized to deliver 45 GyE to the PTV1 and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) of an additional 22.5 GyE to the PTV2 for a total prescribed dose of 67.5 GyE in 15 daily fractions (Figure ).\nA single right lateral beam angle was used with alternating energy layer volumetric rescanning (AELVR), an advanced technique to mitigate the interplay effect of spot scanning delivery and respiratory motion while reducing the beam delivery time to improve breath hold duty cycle (Figure ).\nAELVR splits the original beam into odd and even layered beams so that only half the dose is delivered to the target in each beam. As the numbers of layers are cut in half, so are the number of breath holds required for each beam. Thus, AELVR allows volumetric rescanning by requiring only half the breath holds and also allows a recovery breathing time for the patient in between beams. Mean dose to the liver minus GTV was 19.0 GyE. Daily image guidance was performed with kilovoltage KV to KV imaging aligning to bony spine and for the weekly quality assurance, slow CT scans were obtained to verify liver positioning during an end-exhaled breath hold.\nHe completed treatment with the expected side effects of mild fatigue and skin reaction. His AFP declined rapidly during treatment, reaching down to 7,800 upon completion of the treatment and subsequently normalizing to 6.6 at five months post-treatment. At this time, he developed severe chest wall pain in the irradiated area without evidence of rib fracture or tumor recurrence on imaging that required oral steroids and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control. Follow-up imaging at seven months post-treatment demonstrated a radiographically complete response in the primary tumor with evidence of post-radiation changes (Figure ).

346,Which of the following is the correct clinical calculator to use?,"A 53 year old Pakistani lady presented to the Medicine clinic of a local hospital in 2004 with a history of heel pain and lower back pain for 5 months. In this period, the patient had sustained a rib fracture and left humeral fracture. There was no history of diabetes, hypertension or any other chronic disease. She had not been on any form of medication, including steroids and traditional drugs widely available and prescribed in the region, prior to the onset of pain. At the time of the fractures, she had been placed on non steroidal anti inflammatory agents, acetaminophen and tramadol. There was no history of illicit drug use and she was a non smoker. Family history was unremarkable, particularly in the context of bone disease, and malignancy.\nInitial laboratory investigations had shown a mildly elevated total calcium level of 10.8 mg/dL {2.7 mmol/L}-(no albumin level result available from that time for correction). Parathormone levels (PTH) had not been determined. There was no vitamin d or renal function report available from that time. X-Ray pelvis revealed lytic lesions in the right iliac bone (Fig. ). A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine showed some signal changes. The differentials based on the MRI were metastatic bone disease or multiple myeloma.\nSerum protein electrophoresis was normal. The patient then got lost to follow-up. Her work up was resumed 4 years later when her bone pains had started flaring up. Bone marrow examinations done back in 2007, and later in 2009, were negative for multiple myeloma. A bone scan in November 2009 showed generalized increased tracer uptake over the skull and both the axial and appendicular skeletons- findings in favor of metabolic bone disease (Fig. a). An initial planar parathyroid sestamibi scan requested by a general practitioner in November 2009 was negative for any functioning parathyroid adenoma in the neck or superior mediastinum. No serum PTH report was available from this time either. Following this workup, the patient was treated empirically for bone pains with calcium supplements, an empiric vitamin d injection, and intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg (without prior bone mineral density assessment via DXA scan). This empiric treatment was instituted by an orthopedic surgeon whom she had been referred to. The patient experienced only a slight improvement in bone pains with this treatment and also developed nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Subsequently, she sought care at the National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Dow University Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.\nAt presentation, the patient was well oriented and of functional class 3 (wheel chair bound, able to walk only with support). Her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. Neck examination revealed no mass or lymphadenopathy. She had a significant proximal myopathy as well as curved thighs. She had shortened fingers, and spinal scoliosis was evident. Severe generalized bone tenderness was elicited. There was no focal deficit. Laboratory investigations at this time showed a calcium level of 15.1 mg/dL{3.775 mmol/L}, (corrected for albumin of 3.6 mg/dL{36 g/L}); Vitamin D3 level of 33.92 ng/mL{84.664 nmol/L}; phosphorus 2.3 mg/dL {0.743 mmol/L}and alkaline phosphatase of 1298 IU/L {21.633 µkat/L}. Her 24 h urine calcium was 155 mg/day {3.875 mmol/day}, with urine calcium to creatinine ratio of 0.02.

The chest pain was sharp, sub-sternal with radiation to the back and epigastrium. It was rated by the patient as being 10/10 in intensity.\nVital signs on admission included a temperature of 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 79 beats/min, blood pressure 170/77 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. On physical exam, at the time of admission, the patient was in mild distress with epigastric tenderness noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.\nLaboratory values included an elevated troponin level that peaked at 0.07ng/ml. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia and non-specific ST and T wave changes. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated at 337 U/L and 215 U/L, respectively. Total bilirubin was normal at 0.38 mg/dL. Lipase was noted to be elevated at 1,174 U/L with triglycerides at 124 mg/dL. A right upper quadrant ultrasound showed cholelithiasis without evidence of choledocholithiasis or cholecystitis (Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrated fatty infiltration within the pancreaticoduodenal groove consistent with acute interstitial pancreatitis (Figure ).\nThe patient improved with intravenous volume resuscitation and electrolyte replacement. Her laboratory parameters improved to lipase 503 U/L (the next day), AST 11 U/L, and ALT 52 U/L (over the course of five days). The patient was discharged after a five-day hospital stay.

913,Which of the following is the correct clinical calculator to use?,"A 59-year-old male patient (90 kg, 180 cm) with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was admitted to an external hospital with fever and cough on March 18, 2020. An external PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, on March 19, 2020, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our university hospital due to acute respiratory insufficiency leading to an endotracheal intubation and progressive deterioration of his general condition (SAPS II 77, SOFA 15). Based on the Berlin criteria, a severe ARDS was diagnosed []. The severity of illness was reevaluated by SAPS II and SOFA score every 24 hours. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by another PCR test in our hospital two days after admission.\nThe following day and despite positive fluid balancing and broad anti-infective therapy including meropenem, vancomycin, azithromycine, itraconazole, and acyclovir, an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) plasma level (4118 pg/mL) was noticed accompanied by fever and hemodynamic instability with norepinephrine demand of 1.2 mg/h.\nIn addition to broad anti-infective therapy, intermittent prone positioning was initiated. In the evening of March 21, 2020, the patient developed a generalized hyperinflammatory condition with markedly elevated inflammatory parameters (IL-6 4302 pg/mL) and acute renal failure (KDIGO 3), requiring initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient was treated with CiCa ®-CVVHD (MultiFiltrate, Fresenius AG, Germany, citrate anticoagulation). CRRT (using a high-flow dialysis catheter) was operated with a blood flow rate of 100 mL/min, dialysate flow of 2000 mL/h, ultrafiltration of 250 mL/h, citrate flow of 4 mmol/L, and calcium flow of 1.7 mmol/L. We additionally administered intravenous unfractionated heparin with a target partial thromboplastin time of 40-50 seconds in the presence of leukostasis in underlying CLL and for thromboprophylaxis in SARS-CoV-2 infection. At this point, after escalated anti-infective therapy failed to decrease inflammatory markers and a further clinical deterioration, we installed a CytoSorb® hemoadsorber into the CRRT circuit in order to control the hyperinflammatory response. The cartridge was placed before the hemofilter. Within 30 minutes after the initiation of CytoSorb® treatment, IL-6 levels had already dropped to 2495 pg/mL, and within 24 hours, hemodynamic stabilization began while norepinephrine requirements could be progressively reduced. Simultaneously, PaO2/FiO2 increased from 90 to 165 mmHg under Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) ventilation (SAPS II 70, SOFA 15) (). CytoSorb® therapy was terminated after 9.2 hours of uninterrupted application in the morning of March 22, 2020. After termination of CytoSorb® therapy, hydrocortisone treatment was started for supportive therapy. During the next two days following discontinuation of CytoSorb® treatment, hyperinflammation could be kept well under control with IL-6 levels dropping further to 20.8 pg/mL (SAPS II 68, SOFA 12). Negative fluid balancing was possible, and norepinephrine administration was tapered off three days after cessation of hemoadsorption therapy. Analgosedation could be reduced, and the patient could be progressively weaned from ventilation. Ten days after CytoSorb® discontinuation, the patient was extubated (SAPS II 68).",ABCD2 Score,CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism,None of the above

The patient reported that he was lying in bed watching television when he suddenly started feeling intense substernal chest pain. He described the pain as if someone was kicking him in the chest, rating the pain at 8/10 in severity. The pain was non-radiating, not reproducible, and without any alleviating or aggravating factors. It was associated with diaphoresis and one episode of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. The patient reported that he was smoking marijuana just one hour prior to the onset of the chest pain. His social history was significant for smoking marijuana six to seven times a day for the past 20 years, he was a social alcohol user, and denied any other illicit substance abuse, including cocaine.\nInitial vital signs were within normal limits with blood pressure (BP) at 116/81 mmHg, an oral temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), a pulse of 61 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97%. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a significant ST depression in V3 and V4 which is shown in Figure .\nInitial troponin was found to be mildly elevated at 0.044 ng/mL by laboratory standards but was clinically negative for myocardial infarction. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabinoids only. However, based on the EKG findings and symptomatology, the patient was treated as non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) team was activated. He was administered 325 mg of aspirin and 180 mg of ticagrelor and taken for PCI. He was found to have 100% stenosis (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow 0) of the first obtuse marginal (OM) artery and the right coronary artery. An EluNIR™ (Cordis, Santa Clara, CA) 2.5 x 24 mm drug-eluting stent (ridaforolimus) was placed in the first OM as it was thought to be the culprit lesion causing the symptoms. Pre and post-PCI catheterization images are shown in Figure .\nThe patient reported that his chest pain was relieved after the procedure. EKG showed complete resolution of the ST depressions after PCI. Troponin was measured again post-procedure and found to be 27.9 ng/mL where it peaked.

A CT scan of the head five hours after the onset of symptoms showed a hyperdense basilar artery on two consecutive 5-mm cut images, indicating an acute basilar artery embolism. After obtaining written informed consent for the endovascular therapy from the patient's family, the angiographic procedure began 5.5 hours after the onset of stroke. Angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the distal basilar artery (). At this point, a loading dose of abciximab (0.25 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. Rapid recanalization was achieved using a minimum dose of thrombolytic agents by performing direct angioplasty first followed by intra-arterial thrombolysis. Angioplasty was performed using a 2.5 mm diameter coronary balloon catheter. The balloon catheter was advanced into the occlusion site and inflated to 4 atm for 30 seconds. Immediately after the angioplasty, the basilar artery was partially recanalized with a restoration of the blood flow to the both superior cerebellar arteries. A microcatheter was then placed just proximal to the occlusion site, and 400,000 units of urokinase were infused at a constant rate for one hour. The completion angiograms demonstrated a partial recanalization of the basilar artery with embolus remaining in the basilar tip and the restoration of blood flow to both the posterior and superior cerebellar arteries.

He had regularly attended the Department of Geriatric Internal Medicine because of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He had a previous history of cerebral infarction of the right corona radiata, bleeding gastric ulcer, hyperuricemia, chronic kidney disease (stage 3), benign prostatic hypertrophy, and stable angina. His medication included metformin 500 mg/day, glimepiride 4 mg/day, aspirin 100 mg/day, omeprazole 10 mg/day, allopurinol 100 mg/day, pravastatin sodium 10 mg/day, and naftopidil 50 mg/day. He had been smoking half a pack a day for 70 years. On his last regular visit in July 2010, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 6.9%, and his usual medications were prescribed. In September 2010 he reported that his physical condition had been poor, and he had been eating only a small lunch but taking his regular medications. When he called his family, dysarthria was noticed. Because right hemiparesis developed the next morning, he was brought to our emergency room with his daughter.\nOn physical examination, he had intact cranial nerves except for dysarthria, a shallow right nasolabial fossa, tongue deviation to the right, and muscle weakness of the right arm with symmetrical, not brisk reflexes. He had no ataxia or numbness, but had decreased vibration sense at both ankles. Body mass index was 21.4, blood pressure was 123/54 mmHg, and heart rate was regular and 64 beats per minute. Body temperature was 36.7°C, and Glasgow coma scale was 14 (E4V4M6). He could say his name but not ‘pen’ or ‘glasses’. There were no other remarkable findings on physical examination including conjunctivae, oral mucosa, cervical lymph nodes, thyroid, heart, respiratory sounds, abdomen, and skin.\nLaboratory findings showed hypoglycemia (casual glucose value 1.8 mmol/L), worsening of renal dysfunction (urea nitrogen 12 mmol/L, creatinine 0.22 mmol/L), anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL, hematocrit 29.2%), hyperkalemia (5.8 mmol/L), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.62 mmol/L). The rest of the findings were normal, including complete blood cell count, coagulation tests, serum transferases, sodium, calcium, phosphate, and C-reactive protein. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 6.9%, and glycated albumin was 21.6% on admission.\nBecause of the laboratory findings, 40 mL of 40% dextrose solution was given intravenously. Blood glucose level rose to 9.6 mmol/L, his signs resolved quickly, and hypoglycemic hemiparesis was diagnosed. Glimepiride, metformin, and valsartan were discontinued. As the neurological signs disappeared quickly on improvement of blood glucose, it was easy to exclude an ischemic stroke. Emergency head imaging was not done. After 48 hours' observation, he was discharged, and no relapse of hypoglycemic attack has been documented to date.

At 6 days before presentation, patient had symptoms of severe cough with streaks of blood and dyspnea on exertion and was treated with azithromycin antibiotic for presumed upper respiratory tract infection. The day before presentation, patient's symptoms of cough and dyspnea started getting worse. Patient reported taking benzonatate antitussive, which caused tingling and numbness around his mouth and cheeks, which resolved spontaneously after 30 min. Patient did not report of hives, swelling of the face or tongue and difficulty in swallowing. Subsequently, patient got extremely agitated and short of breath leading to state of unconsciousness. Emergency medical services were activated, 100% oxygen was initiated and patient was transferred to our ER.\nIn the ER, patient presented with grey colored skin and symptoms of severe dyspnea. As per the patient's wife, he had no calf pain and/or swelling recently. There were no recent hospitalizations, prolonged immobilization or history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombus (DVT). He had no other medical procedures and/or surgeries performed in the recent past. Patient's father has a history of PE secondary to extensive airplane travel and stroke. Patient has no history of familial clotting disorders. Consequently, patient developed complete heart block and received intravenous atropine and epinephrine. An electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads with elevated troponins of 13.5 ng/ml (normal <0.03 ng/ml). Cardiac monitor showed pulseless electric activity and patient was intubated and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated immediately. The cardiac arrest was presumed from ST elevation myocardial infarction and the patient was transferred to cardiac catheterization laboratory. Patient intermittently remained in cardiac arrest requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and temporary pacemaker. Short episodes of CPR were performed. Cardiac catheterization showed non-obstructive coronary arteries and a hyper-dynamic left ventricle. Patient's blood pressure remained low and so patient was continued on epinephrine, dopamine drips. Patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit and he remained intubated with mechanical ventilation and ongoing CPR. On physical examination, the patient was noted to have respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, fixed and dilated pupils of 7 mm and endotracheal tube in place. His neck was supple without jugular vein distention. Chest examination revealed distant lung sounds, with no wheezing. Cardiac auscultation was tachycardia with no murmurs, gallops and rubs. On neurologic al examination, the patient's Glasgow coma scale was <9 with no gag reflex and response to Babinski. Rest of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data revealed white cell count of 11.7 × 109/L (normal 4.3-10 × 109/L) with the normal differentials, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dl (normal 0.7-1.3 mg/dl), ionized calcium of 4.0 mg/dl (normal 4.6-5.1 mg/dl) bicarbonate of 15 mmol/L (normal 22-30 mmol/L), anion gap of 21 mmol/L (normal 8-16 mmol/L) and lactic acid of 16 mmol/L (normal 0.7-2.1 mmol/L) and D-dimer of 6.68 μg/ml (normal <0.49 μg/ml).",National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS),PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,Anion Gap,Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS),None of the above

He also has a history of behavioral and psychological disorder of dementia and recurrent falls from a lack of safety awareness. His weight taken on 19 June 2019 was 62.6 kg with a height of 1.60 cm, giving a body mass index of 24.4 kg/m2. The patient was on the following oral medications (Box ) long term prior to the addition of rivaroxaban 10 mg OM for chronic atrial flutter and previous ischemic stroke.\nHe had an episode of severe infective exacerbation of COPD as a result of postviral pneumonia, which was complicated by septic shock, multiorgan failure, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and new anemia in December 2018, for which he was admitted to the intensive care unit for inotrope support and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The liver and respiratory function recovered, but the renal function did not and led to new chronic kidney disease, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 31 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equations on 19 June 2019. He developed new atrial flutter which persisted but was not started on oral anticoagulation immediately due to concerns with regards the new multiorgan failure and unexplained new anemia in the intensive care unit. He was eventually started on rivaroxaban on 17 April 2019 after physical recovery to his premorbid state with three months of rehabilitation and medical review at the local geriatric day hospital and stabilization of his hemoglobin and renal function.\nHe presented to Dermatology Department 12 weeks later on 11 July 2019 with complaints of new papular rash over the palmar aspects of both hands with small vesicles over 1-week duration (Figure ).

She attended the Emergency Department four years ago complaining of several episodes of vomiting, abdominal distension, and epigastric pain after a copious meal. There were no peritoneal irritation signs and laboratory results included high concentrations of lipase (2.691 U/L) and triglycerides (TG) (1.148 mg/dL). She was started on intravenous fluids, antispasmodics, and analgesics with complete resolution of symptoms and was therefore discharged.\nThe patient was lost on follow-up and apparently replaced allopathic treatment for dyslipidemia (fibrate plus high-potency statin) with homeopathic medications. After three years, she complained again of abdominal epigastric pain irradiated to right lumbar quadrant. Basic blood tests were otherwise normal with the exception of high levels of transaminases (AST 427.1 U/L, ALT 374 U/L). Abdominal contrasted computed tomography and magnetic resonance showed inflammation of the pancreatic head, neck and uncinated process with plastron and signs of portal hypertension (). Based on normal serum lipase (43 U/L), these findings were considered as incidental non-acute pancreatitis and treatment was disregarded; on the contrary, a diagnosis of toxic hepatitis caused by homeopathic drugs was suggested.\nOne month later, nausea, abdominal pain, and distension recurred on epigastrium and right hypochondrium. Laboratories obtained were positive for HTG (2.066 mg/dL) with elevated lipase (982 U/L) in the settings of acute pancreatitis (APACHE II score: 8). Suddenly, she exhibited an altered state of consciousness and hypotension (MBP 40 mmHg) and was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit for four days. Considering that the clinical picture was consistent with a very-severe hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis and that worrisome characteristics were present, the gastroenterology team started her on unfractionated heparin infusion for 3 days (5000 UI/5 hrs) that resulted in a reduction of up to 89.30% (221 mg/dL) and 44.7% (543 U/L) on TG and lipase, respectively. Symptoms resolved completely. A fourth and short hospitalization occurred in the last semester, referring the aforementioned symptoms but lipase concentrations were 443 mg/dL.\nOver this year, fibrates have been rotated from gemfibrozil to fenofibrate and ciprofibrate due to fluctuations on TG levels (). She was also prescribed metformin, orlistat and eicosapentaenoic acid with a mild effect. The ambulatory comprehensive analysis included a transthoracic echocardiogram that only reported a mildly-enlarged left atrium (diameter: 42 mm and volume: 37 mL/m2) and a carotid duplex ultrasound which found no atherosclerosis.

Three months after the beginning of the infusions, he developed painful nodules and abscesses of the axillary folds and groins. Most lesions cleared or drained spontaneously but there were new flares every week, requiring sometimes surgical drainage. The patient had a history of severe acne during puberty. He had no personal/family history of HS and no other medical condition associated with metabolic syndrome. On examination, there were inflammatory nodules and plaques, abscesses, but no fistula nor scars (A,B). Bacterial culture on pus swab from a fistulated abscess and folliculitis were positives for a Streptococcus Agalactiae group B and a Staphylococcus Epidermidis.\nA diagnosis of nivolumab-HS, stage Hurley 1 was made. Following an unsuccessful three month-period lymecycline 300 mg q.d. therapy, he received a combination of doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. and zinc gluconate 60 mg q.d.

After the episode, the electrocardiogram was normal, with a QTc interval of 420 ms. Postoperatively, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response was recorded, which was treated with intravenous amiodarone at an infusion rate of approximately 2 mg/min, following initial rapid administration of 150 mg over 10 minutes. Sinus rhythm was restored after 1 hour, but drug administration was continued for 12 hours, with a total amiodarone dosage of 1.65 g ().\nQTc prolongation (at 623 ms) associated with hypokalemia (K+ : 2.54 meq/L) was noted and the patient was placed under continuous telemetry recording. Approximately 48 hours after amiodarone administration, torsade de pointes was recorded () and prompt defibrillation restored sinus rhythm. An acute coronary syndrome was ruled out and echocardiography was normal. Despite intravenous potassium and magnesium administration, two further episodes of torsade de pointes occurred, requiring the addition of isoproterenol infusion for 24 hours. At this time point, normal serum electrolyte values were recorded (Na+ : 138 meq/L, K+ : 4.79 meq/L, Mg++ : 1.7 meq/L) and the patient subsequently remained arrhythmia-free on telemetry recording. However, prolonged hospitalization was required, because QTc prolongation persisted until the 14th hospital day ().\nBlood biochemistry and thyroid function tests were normal and serum potassium was within normal limits during the remaining hospitalization period.

He was known to have liver cirrhosis. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 105/68 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 beats per min, and body temperature was 38.2℃. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness on the whole abdomen, diminished bowel sound, and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin concentration of 12.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 7,580/µL, platelet count of 233,000/µL, serum creatinine level of 1.36 mg/dL, serum bilirubin level of 5.0 mg/dL, and serum albumin level of 2.5 g/dL. The analysis of peritoneal fluid demonstrated an albumin level of 284 mg/dL and leukocyte count of 350/µL (poly 89%, other 5%). The Child-Pugh score was 13. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hr) was started with the presumptive diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Several days later, gram negative bacilli were growing in the cultures of blood and ascites processed by the BACTEC 9240 unit (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, U.S.A.). The patient's subsequent hospital course was uneventful except for low-grade fever (≤38℃). On the 8th day of admission, his blood pressure was 66/40 mmHg, pulse rate was 94 beats per min, and body temperature was 35.2℃.

We tried to perform an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) because of his black and tarry stool, but the patient and his family refused to give his consent to EGD. At that time, the gram-negative bacillus was identified as O. anthropi by the Gram negative Combo 32 kit (Microscan Workaway-96, Dade Behring, West Sacramento, CA, U.S.A.), and the biochemical profile determined by the API 20 NE system (BioMerieus, Marcy l'Etoile, France) also gave unequivocal identification of O. anthropi. The organism yielded positive results in tests for urea, ornithine, and esculin hydrolysis and failed to produce hydrogen sulfide in triple-sugar-iron agar, which is collectively consistent with O. anthropi. The isolate was in vitro susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trimethoprim but resistant to all other tested (β-lactam antibiotics including ceftriaxone).

He described the pain as if someone was kicking him in the chest, rating the pain at 8/10 in severity. The pain was non-radiating, not reproducible, and without any alleviating or aggravating factors. It was associated with diaphoresis and one episode of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. The patient reported that he was smoking marijuana just one hour prior to the onset of the chest pain. His social history was significant for smoking marijuana six to seven times a day for the past 20 years, he was a social alcohol user, and denied any other illicit substance abuse, including cocaine.\nInitial vital signs were within normal limits with blood pressure (BP) at 116/81 mmHg, an oral temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), a pulse of 61 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

777,Which of the following is the correct clinical calculator to use?,"A 34-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with right-sided hemiparesis and hemianesthesia. On admission, the NIHSS and mRs scores were 6 and 3, respectively. She awoke with stroke symptoms at 07.00 AM, was last seen without symptoms at 11.00 p.m. the preceding day, and was admitted to the stroke unit at 10.00 a.m. She had a history of hyperlipidemia and oral hormonal contraceptive use. Following the blood investigations and CT scan, MRI with DWI and FLAIR sequences was performed. We were doubtful as to whether there was a mismatch present (Figure ); however, 1D the radiologist identified an evident focus on DWI that corresponded to a faintly distinct hyperintense focus on FLAIR. Due to the patient's young age, the increased risk of disability, and the lack of any clearly visible changes on FLAIR, after obtaining the patient's consent, we administered 57 mg of alteplase. No intracranial bleeding was shown in the control CT and she was discharged with mRs scores of 1.",CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity,Corrected QT Interval,National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS),HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance),None of the above
492,Which of the following is the correct clinical calculator to use?,"We report a 43-year-old male patient who was diagnosed as TA-TMA after allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation from HLA matched sibling donor and treated with eculizumab.\nThe patient was diagnosed with stage 4 ALK negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma after splenectomy due to uncontrolled splenic hemorrhage. Considering the aggressive nature of the disease, CHOP regimen initiated immediately after diagnosis and staging procedures. After two cycles of CHOP regimen, no significant response was achieved and ESHAP regimen initiated. After two cycles of ESHAP regimen, a short term partial response could be achieved and allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation was applied from HLA matched (10/10) sibling donor of the patient because of progressive disease []. Cells were collected peripherally and the amount of reinfused CD34+ cells was 5.3 × 106/kg. Busulfan and cyclophosphamide were used as conditioning and cyclosporine used for the prophylaxis of graft versus host disease. At the 7th day of reinfusion, acinetobacter sepsis developed and patient was put on to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. While recovering from acinetobacter sepsis, a rapid neurological and renal deterioration was observed. Patient was stuporous and had a tonic-clonic epileptic seizure; he also had a severe headache and hallucinations before the onset of seizure. Meanwhile, the ldh level was increased dramatically up to 3200 U/L and schistocytes were detected at the peripheral blood smear (20–30/HPF). Despite being hyponormotensive during the period of sepsis, he had hypertensive episodes with a maximum of 180/100 mmHg accompanying the neurological symptoms. Cranial MRI and lumbar puncture revealed no pathological feature. CSF culture was negative and cytological analysis revealed no malignant cells. Viral analysis of CSF and blood was negative regarding CMV and EBV. His Hb level has decreased from 9.5 to 7.2 g/dL with an MCV of 96 fL and reticulocyte count of 2.49%. Both direct and indirect coombs tests were negative and haptoglobulin level was slightly decreased below the lower limit of normal. After ruling out an ongoing infectious disease, cerebrovascular event, and malignant infiltration of CNS with lymphoma, patient was diagnosed, as TA-TMA. ADAMTS13 activity was %37 with no detectable inhibitors. All complement levels were in normal range (C3, C4, Factor H, and Factor I). Urinalysis revealed a protein concentration of 120 mg/dL. Calcineurin inhibitor stopped immediately after diagnosis and plasma exchange was initiated. Plasma exchange was performed on a daily basis with 1.5 plasma volumes, using FFP as a replacement fluid.

573,Which of the following is the correct clinical calculator to use?,"A 69-year-old woman with repaired TOF suffering from recurrent haemoptysis was referred to our institution for further investigations. She underwent palliation in 1962 (age 12) with a classic right-sided BTT shunt and TOF repair in 1967 (age 17) with closure of the VSD, relief of the RV outflow tract obstruction, and closure of the BTT shunt. Over the course of the years, she developed atrial fibrillation for which she was started on oral anticoagulation. In 1993, she had a first episode of massive haemoptysis which was treated conservatively. In 2002, computed tomography (CT) indicated a stellate nodule in the right upper lung lobe. Over the next years the lesion remained stable on axial follow-up imaging. In 2019, after new episodes of haemoptysis, this time with progressively worsening dyspnoea, a positron emission tomography–CT was performed showing isotope accumulation in the lesion of the right upper lung lobe (). She underwent a bronchoscopy that showed mucosal swelling in the right upper lobe. Cytology indicated acute inflammation without evidence of malignancy.\nOn physical examination, the right-sided radial pulse was absent and blood pressure (BP) not measurable. Blood pressure and heart rate taken on the left arm were 112/45 mmHg and 78 b.p.m., respectively. Respiratory rate was 22 per minute. The second heart sound was pronounced with a grade 3/6 systolic and 2/4 diastolic murmur at the second intercostal space on the left. C-reactive protein was normal (2.9 mg/L) and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide slightly elevated (733 ng/L). The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with inferolateral ST depression and Q-waves in V1–V2–aVR (). Transthoracic echocardiography indicated a moderately dilated RV with normal systolic function, a peak/mean gradient of 53/32 mmHg across the pulmonary valve with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation ().\nA diagnostic cardiac catheterization was performed but no arteriovenous connections were seen and the BTT shunt was not patent. Right atrial pressure was 14 mmHg, RV systolic pressure 56 mmHg, systolic pulmonary artery pressure 33 mmHg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure 21 mmHg. The RV was dilated with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation. A bronchoscopy with EndoBronchial UltraSound (EBUS) in order to perform EBUS guided biopsy was performed. A rope-like structure was seen through the bronchoscope, but we were unable to take a biopsy ().\nAfter multidisciplinary discussion, the findings appeared to be most consistent with chronic inflammation due to a foreign body with secondary chronic inflammation, rather than vasculitis or a granulomatous infection, and the patient underwent a thoracotomy with lobectomy of the superior lobe of the right lung. The foreign body was removed without any resistance nor bleeding. Pathology indicated diffuse necrotizing granulomatous inflammation around the rope-like structure ( and ) which appeared to be the old suture around the BTT shunt that had caused a chronic inflammatory reaction invading the right upper bronchus and causing haemoptysis. The patient remained stable after the procedure. She left the hospital after a couple of days. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. After 3 months, she underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement. After the surgical intervention, given a CHA2DS2 VASc score of 6/9, the fact that the most likely source of haemoptysis was removed, she was started on edoxaban 60 mg once daily.",Calculated LDL,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism,Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),None of the above
