11,Her weight on admission was 37.3 kg (body mass index [BMI] = 12.6).,bmi,12.6,kg/m2,"A 45-year-old female was brought in by ambulance after collapsing at home secondary to a hypoglycemic event (capillary blood glucose of 1 mmol/L with paramedics). She had a history of restrictive AN, binge-purge behaviour, and an old traumatic brain injury, leaving her with memory problems. She was well known to mental health services, having been admitted multiple times to eating disorder centres for nasogastric feeding. She had never smoked in her life and denied any alcohol intake. The patient was on ferrous fumarate, fexofenadine, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, lansoprazole, quetiapine, supplemental vitamins, regular morphine (modified release), and gabapentin.\nOn admission, her blood pressure was 106/85 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, heart rate was 64 beats/minute, temperature was 35.1 °C, and capillary blood glucose was 6 mmol/L. Her weight on admission was 37.3 kg (body mass index [BMI] = 12.6). On examination, she was clearly malnourished, cachexic, and dehydrated. The rest of the clinical examination was normal, as shown in Table . Her chest radiograph showed patchy consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes (Figure ). She was prescribed appropriate antibiotics. She was refusing treatment and was deemed to lack the capacity to make that decision. Therefore, Section 5(2) under the Mental Health Act was put in place. She was commenced on oral supplements as per guidance from the dietitian, and then switched to nasogastric feeding.\nOn the night of the second day, she had an episode of decreased consciousness, bradypnoea (RR-6), and hypotension (83/64). Her blood sugar level was 6.6 mmol/L. After receiving Naloxone, her symptoms improved, and her opiates were discontinued. The following day she mentioned right upper quadrant pain. Blood tests showed worsening liver enzymes, as shown in Table . An abdominal ultrasound was performed on the fourth day of admission, which showed multiple small calculi and biliary debris, with gallbladder oedema, and a small amount of peri-cholecystic fluid (Figure ).\nShe was treated for cholecystitis with amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, and clarithromycin, which led to improvement in her inflammatory markers in the following days. She underwent an inpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to rule out intra-biliary pathology, which was negative. Subsequently, she was referred to surgeons for consideration of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy once deemed fit.\nShe had a protracted and difficult admission. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, her transfer to an Eating Disorders Unit proved difficult. By the fourth week of admission, her liver enzymes had improved, as can be seen in Table . Nasogastric feeding was successfully weaned as her weight improved. She was discharged on day 51 to an Eating Disorders Unit weighing 56.4 kg (BMI = 18.1) from her admission weight of 37.3 kg (BMI = 12.6).",Body Mass Index (BMI),"A 45-year-old female was brought in by ambulance after collapsing at home secondary to a hypoglycemic event (capillary blood glucose of 1 mmol/L with paramedics).

12,his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15.,gcs,15,,"A 29-year-old male was brought to the hospital by ambulance after collapsing at home. He was found to be bradycardic and hypoglycaemic with a capillary blood glucose level of 2.3 mmol/L. He had a history of eating and anxiety disorders and was not on any regular medications. On admission, his weight was 37.3 kg (BMI = 11.6). His blood pressure was initially un-recordable but subsequently was recorded to be 104/72 mmHg. His capillary blood glucose level was 4.7 mmol/L, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15. On examination, he was noted to be severely malnourished and cachexic. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. LFTs were very abnormal, as shown in Table .\nSince admission, he seemed to lack insight. Due to problems keeping him compliant with medication and intravenous glucose, he had a number of hypoglycaemic events in the first two days of admission. The following day, he was deemed not to have the capacity. He underwent Mental Capacity Assessment and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. He was ultimately placed under Mental Health Act 5(2) and was started on nasogastric feeding. His liver enzymes worsened further after the introduction of nasogastric feeding, but we were reassured by a normal non-invasive liver screen and ultrasound.\nHis condition, liver tests, and liver synthetic function improved over the course of his 24-day admission (Table ), but his stay was associated with difficult behaviour. He was eventually discharged to an Eating Disorders Unit.",Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS),"A 29-year-old male was brought to the hospital by ambulance after collapsing at home.

16,"Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471.",qtc,471,ms,"We describe the case of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services for the chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath that woke him from his sleep just prior to arrival. He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event. His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol. Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature was 36.3°C.\nPhysical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic. He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited. Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.\nDue to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered. CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.\nComplete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67 mg/dl, creatinine 14.7 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 165. Troponin I was <0.012 ng/mL. Initial lactic acid was recorded at 13.9 mmol/L. An arterial blood gas revealed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 22.3 mmHg, pO2 of 105.5 mmHg, HCO3 of 5.3 meq/L, and a Base Excess of -24.8 mmol/l. The patient was anuric at this time. Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471. The CT scan revealed an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction (Figures , ) and at the right ureterovesical junction (Figure ), with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis (Figure ).\nWhile in the ED the patient progressively became hypotensive and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, due to concern for sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated. The patient did not respond to fluid resuscitation and was started initially on Levophed. In addition, the patient received 100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 2 grams of calcium gluconate for severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Due to the expected clinical decline, the patient was intubated in the emergency department. Critical Care, Nephrology, and Urology were consulted emergently in the ED. After initial stabilization, the patient was taken for immediate bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) placement by Interventional Radiology (IR) and placement of a trialysis catheter for initiation of hemodialysis afterward. Urinalysis from the PCN revealed hematuria, but no evidence of infection.\nAfter successful placement of bilateral PCN, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition. He was maintained on multiple vasopressors consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine along with stress dose hydrocortisone. Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis. After hemodialysis, the patient’s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L. Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Within 24 hours the patient’s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors. A repeat chemistry revealed recovering renal function along with urine production in the nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 3, the patient was successfully extubated, weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped. Blood and urine cultures taken prior to dialysis were negative after five days. On hospital day 6, Urology performed a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and removal of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 8, the patient had made a remarkable recovery from being critically ill. His creatinine was 1.5, BUN 27, and he was discharged home with urology follow-up in 1-2 weeks.",Corrected QT Interval,"We describe the case of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services for the chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath that woke him from his sleep just prior to arrival.

47,"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 26, suggesting a severe stroke.",nihss,26,,"A 90-year-old male was found in his home slumped to his right side and unable to be awakened. Paramedics calculated an 8/15 Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, which remained the same on admission. On presentation to the hospital, the patient had left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 26, suggesting a severe stroke. All other observations on admission were non-revealing, including vital signs, biochemical tests, and systems review.\nThe patient’s neurological medical history included two previous transient ischemic attacks and suspected dementia. Other past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, adult polycystic kidney disease, hypercholesterolemia, and aortic valve sclerosis. He was an ex-smoker of unknown pack-years and prior to admission was living independently.\nInitial head CT performed only showed chronic small vessel disease with periventricular leukoaraiosis, consistent with his age. Thrombolysis was initiated with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator, however, the patient’s GCS declined to 6/15 approximately 40 minutes after the start of thrombolysis. A repeat head CT was performed, again showing no acute findings. To prevent further deterioration, a decision to monitor the patient’s condition conservatively was made.\nOver the next few days, the patient remained very somnolent. When the patient was able to awaken, he was only capable of responding to simple commands. Speech and language therapists noted that fatigue was limiting conversations, with the patient speaking with imprecise articulation and at a low volume. Occupational therapists concurred that the patient was poorly engaged during sessions, while physiotherapists classified this patient as having limited rehabilitation potential.\nStroke was finally confirmed upon a third head CT several days after admission, which showed bilateral thalamic infarcts. Other findings included hyperdensity at the basilar tip and left posterior cerebral artery, likely due to wall calcification of vessels. An MRI revealed bilateral hyperintensities in the thalami, consistent with acute bilateral thalamic stroke, with small left parietal cortical infarction (Figure ).\nImaging also confirmed the arterial location of the infarction, a single branch of the pre-communicating (P1) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery known as the artery of Percheron (AOP). Over the next month, the patient participated in multidisciplinary rehabilitation sessions. He had a gradual return of physical function and with it, his sense of humor returned, much to the delight of his family and the attending staff. He was unable to care for himself independently and was eventually discharged to a care home. Six months later, he was mobile with a walking stick and had a reasonable quality of life. One year after the initial presentation to the hospital, he passed away from an intercurrent chest infection.",National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS),"A 90-year-old male was found in his home slumped to his right side and unable to be awakened.

70,CHA2DS2-VASC score 1,cha2ds2,1,,"The first patient is a 53-year-old male with a long history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He had some cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure that had been well controlled for 5 years on a therapy with ACE inhibitor. He did not suffer from other relevant comorbidities, except for sleep apnea syndrome on home nocturnal ventilatory support. He had his first episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation six years before and he started oral anticoagulation with dabigatran (CHA2DS2-VASC score 1) and antiarrhythmic therapy, initially with Flecainide and then with Amiodarone. Despite this, he had been admitted several times to the emergency room due to irregular heartbeat episodes and other symptoms, such as palpitations and shortness of breath. The arrhythmic recurrences often required electrical or pharmacological cardioversions to control the symptoms. The patient was then referred to our clinic because of the gradual worsening of his symptoms. The arrhythmic episodes lasted several hours, with spontaneous resolution, crippling him in his daily life. Considering his young age, the absence of cardiac structural alterations, and the inefficacy of the rhythm control strategy, AF ablation was proposed to the patient. At admission into the ward, the patient was overweight (body mass index was 38 kg/m2) and the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, while the pre-procedure echocardiography revealed dilated left atrium (left atrial volume 43 mL/m2) and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle of 55%.\nWe started the procedure by performing a bipolar map of the right atrium with a ThermoCool SmartTouch™ SF (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA) ablation catheter. First, we delineated the inferior and superior vena cava, and the coronary sinus, and we tagged in yellow the His potential (A). Next, we carefully reconstructed the interatrial septum and, finally, to precisely define the fossa ovalis (FO), we set the color range on the bipolar map to 0.25–0.75 mV and we tagged in light blue all the fragmented and low voltage signals, which are typical of the FO area [] (A). The FO location was further confirmed by the ICE and the CartoSound® module (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA). A 10F Soundstar™ Ultrasound catheter was advanced in the right atrium and pointed at the FO. Thanks to the CartoSound® module, it was possible to mark the contours of the FO location and to visualize them on the 3D EAM previously obtained (B). In addition to the FO, using ICE and the CartoSound® module, it was possible to assess and to reconstruct the structures of the left atrium (left atrial appendage, pulmonary veins, and esophagus). Next, a single transseptal puncture was performed using the bidirectional guiding sheath VIZIGO™ (8.5F) and a transseptal needle (standard Brockenbrough needle 98 cm from Abbott, St. Paul, MN, USA). Since the sheath is visible on the Carto 3® EAM system, it was possible to place it in the superior vena cava (3 to 4 cm above the cavoatrial junction) without any use of fluoroscopy. At this point, the guidewire was removed and the transseptal needle with the stylet was gently inserted and advanced through VIZIGO™, avoiding pushing the needle over the tip of the sheath. In this step, the needle and the sheath were held in the fingers between 4 and 6 o’clock. The needle and the sheath were pulled back caudally, visualizing the VIZIGO™ sheath with the 3D EAM system until it reached the level of the coronary sinus and the tip of the dilator inside the sheath placed in the FO. From this location, the VIZIGO™ sheath was pushed and placed on the FO under the guidance of the EAM system and confirmed by ICE imaging (C). When the sheath was in the right position, the transseptal needle was advanced to perform the puncture. Live tracking of the distal part of the needle on the 3D EAM system was possible thanks to an Alligator clip lead wires (FIAB Spa, Florence, Italy) connected to the distal portion of the needle (see ). Both the transseptal sheath and the needle should be advanced for 1–2 cm in the left atrium (LA). Then, holding the needle, the sheath was advanced over the needle. Finally, the needle and the dilator were kept steady, and the sheath was advanced over the dilator. The transseptal sheath was deaired and a 0.032 inch guidewire was advanced toward the left superior pulmonary vein under ICE guidance.\nAfter a successful transseptal puncture, the ThermoCool SmartTouch™ SF catheter was advanced through the VIZIGO™ sheath into the left atrium to perform a fast anatomical mapping and PVI following the CLOSE protocol []. With the help of the VIZIGO™ steerable sheath, we performed ablations with good contact and stability, leading to fast and effective PVI. There were no complications during the entire procedure. The procedure time was 100 min, radiofrequency time was 20 min, and, finally, the fluoroscopy time was 00:00 min:s. The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode. After a 9 months follow-up, the patient presents no more symptoms, is not taking any antiarrhythmic drugs, and does not have recurrences of AF. He is taking apixaban 5 mg twice a day and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control.",CHA2DS2-VASc Score for AF,"The first patient is a 53-year-old male with a long history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

72,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 12,sofa,12,,"A 20-year-old Caucasian male (1.75 m tall and 76 kg (BMI 24.8)), was admitted to the medical department for persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor. Persistent symptoms started at home 4 days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed jaundice, dry mucous membranes, pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate, and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. He was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute) and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air was 92%. The abdominal palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory tests showed a white blood count (WBC) of 8000 cells/mcL with 74% neutrophils, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 31,000/mcL), total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, AST 150 UI/L, ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly ().\nThe neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein ().\nOn the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) spectrometry -Vitek ®MS Blood cultures performed at admission and on the second day and collected in standard anaerobic blood culture bottles were positive ().\nThe association of retropharyngeal abscess with thrombosis of the anterior jugular and involvement of other organs systemically and the microbiology led to the diagnosis of Lemierre’s syndrome. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (18 g/day, continuous infusion), there was a rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of the respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations (mean arterial pressure (MAP) constantly <65 mmHg). This picture suggested a progression towards a septic shock status. Consequently, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\nA multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre’s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) ().\nThe source control was planned in a sterile environment. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. Unfortunately, although the procedure revealed purulent material, surgeons were unable to collect suitable samples for microbiological testing.\nAt ICU admission, the patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and the need for deep sedation (propofol, remifentanil, and clonidine), and mechanical ventilation through protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg and driving pressure < 15 cmH2O) and high FiO2 (80%). The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 12, predicting a high mortality rate (50%) [].\nAbout antibiotic therapy, metronidazole (500 mg q8hr, intravenously) was added to piperacillin/tazobactam (started empirically at hospital admission). This antibiotic therapy was based on anecdotal clinical evidence because, due to the lack of cards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes in the laboratory, the antibiogram was not performed.\nHemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin (also known as arginine-vasopressin or anti-diuretic hormone) (EMPRESSIN® AOP Orphan Pharmaceutical Group) starting with norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and argipressin at 0.03 IU/min to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg and lactic acid < 2 mmol/L. On day 2, the drug synergism allowed the rapid reduction of the norepinephrine and argipressin dosages (0.1 mcg/kg/min and 0.025 IU/min, respectively) ().\nOn the same day (day 2), there was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved ().\nDespite the adequate MAP (>65 mmHg), from the 3rd to the 6th day of ICU admission, there was a new worsening of the clinical status. It featured anemia (worse value 6.8 g/dL) without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring (Edwards EV1000™ device) showed a hyperdynamic septic state (Cardiac Output 15 L/min, Systemic Vascular Resistance 300 dynes/seconds/cm). Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, on the 8th day, hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) was added to argipressin and norepinephrine. This approach led to a paramount hemodynamic improvement. From the 8th day of hospitalization, there was a progressive reduction of the dose of both vasoconstrictors until the suspension of norepinephrine, on day 9, and argipressin, on day 12 of ICU stay. Moreover, there was an important decrease in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (from 12 on ICU admission to 7 on day 9).\nThe worsening of the clinical status and the anemia were associated with bilirubin and cytokines rise. The inflammatory response was treated by 4 cycles of continuous hemofiltration (from 4th to 7th day). At the end of the procedure, there was an unexpected rise in D-dimers and in bilirubin values, up to 15.3 mg/dL (10th day), as well as hyperpyrexia. Nevertheless, these findings improved within 24 h.\nHeparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia (enoxaparin 6000 U/day at the beginning and 4000 U twice a day after normalization of the platelet count) monitoring D-dimer values and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy.\nOn the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion and a new CT was carried out. It showed a persistence of the known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as the normalization of hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program. After the discharge to the rehabilitation care unit, the young man was in good health condition. At the first follow up, performed 15 days after ICU admission, the CT scan showed better lungs ventilation, absence of retropharyngeal abscess, laterocervical lymphadenopathy, and internal jugular thrombosis. Hepatosplenomegaly and some cavitary lungs lesions were found. Another thoracic CT scan was performed after 3 months. It demonstrated an improvement of both the lung lesions and hepatosplenomegaly.",Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,"A 20-year-old Caucasian male (1.75 m tall and 76 kg (BMI 24.8)), was admitted to the medical department for persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor.

His personal and family medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a huge HCC mass in segment 4 and PVTT invasion from the nearby portal vein to the left portal trunk, main portal trunk, through to the contralateral right portal trunk. The tip of the PVTT progressed over to the bifurcation of the anterior and posterior branches of the portal trunk. The anterior branch was filled with PVTT, while the posterior branch was filled with PVTT or blood thrombus (Fig. ). No apparent intra- and extra-hepatic metastases were detected other than the main tumor. Laboratory data showed a serum albumin level of 3.8 g/dL, total bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dL, platelet count of 13.9 × 104/uL, and a Child-Pugh score of 6. Serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II were 90,770 ng/mL and 2847 mAU/mL, respectively. An antithrombotic drug was administered for the PVTT. Due to the overwhelming PVTT extensions, poor performance status, and old age, the patient was deemed not to have a surgical indication. Therefore, a combination treatment using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT was selected. During preparation for radiotherapy, one-time atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) were administered. He developed anal pain and persistent fever 9 days after administration, and CT showed perianal abscess due to anal fistula. Although he recovered soon after percutaneous abscess drainage, this adverse event interrupted atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, and radiotherapy could not be introduced. Abdominal CT, conducted 3 weeks after the first administration, showed size reduction of the main tumor and PVTT, with a reduction in tumor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT. Serum AFP decreased from 90,700 ng/mL before treatment to 18,371 ng/mL and 6301 ng/mL 3 and 5 weeks after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, respectively. Considering the excellent response to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment (one-time administration), we decided to continue with this treatment after creating colostomy. Colostomy was performed 47 days after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Subsequently, beginning from the 83rd day after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, atezolizumab monotherapy was initiated. The reason for choosing atezolizumab monotherapy was that the bleeding from the colostomy persists from the collateral blood circulation due to the liver cirrhosis. The serum AFP decreased to 89 ng/mL just before the next atezolizumab monotherapy, and abdominal CT showed continued partial response (Fig. ); serum AFP levels kept decreasing toward the normal range (Fig. ). He received a one-time atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment and continued with atezolizumab monotherapy afterward (9 regimens administered until now); there is no apparent sign of residual tumors at 9 months after the introduction of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment.",Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality,"An 82-year-old male patient with angina on anticoagulant medication and without viral infection was referred to our department for the surgical treatment of HCC.

Laboratory studies revealed massively elevated transaminases with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 4645 U/l and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 4956 U/l (normal < 50 U/l) while cholestatic liver enzymes were merely elevated (alkaline phosphatase (AP) 216 (normal 25–124) U/l and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (γ-GT) 91 (normal < 55 U/l)). Furthermore, liver synthesis parameters were significantly impaired with a total bilirubin of 14.8 (normal 0.3–1.2) mg/dl, an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.39, and a factor V activity of < 35 (normal 70–120) % with a consecutive MELD score of 28 points. Additionally, there was no serological evidence for autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis (A-E), Wilson’s disease or hemochromatosis. Laboratory parameters on admission are presented in Table . According to the above-mentioned parameters and circumstances, the patient was diagnosed with a cryptgenic ALF and treated supportively by substitution of vitamin K, ursodeoxycholic acid, and lactulose.\nAccordingly, liver maximum capacity (LiMAx) test on admission revealed significant impairment of enzymatic liver function of 147 (normal > 315) μg/h/kg. Two days later, laboratory parameters further deteriorated: the patient now fulfilled the KCC for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF ((1) unknown etiology; (2) INR > 3.5; (3) bilirubin > 17.4 mg/dl), and he was considered for urgent liver transplantation at Eurotransplant. Three days later, the patient became anuric and hemodialysis was necessary with a MELD score of 40 points. However, a suitable donor organ was not available. Two days later, the patient developed hepatic encephalopathy grade III-IV accompanied by increasing inflammatory parameters in blood (increase of leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) and respiratory insufficiency, which made mechanical ventilation necessary. Computed tomography scan revealed bilateral pneumonia and antibiotic (imipenem) and antifungal (caspofungin) therapy was initiated (Fig. ). Bloodstream infection with evidence of Staphylococcus aureus was ascertained concurrently. Due to pulmonary Staphylococcus aureus sepsis the patient was no longer suitable for urgent LT at that critical juncture.\nInterestingly, LiMAx test, which was performed under mechanical ventilation, showed an improvement of enzymatic liver function to 169 μg/h/kg indicating liver regeneration, though laboratory tests (deterioration of conventional liver synthesis parameters, rapid increase of inflammatory parameters in blood) and clinical course (multi-organ system failure: liver and renal insufficiency, encephalopathy, sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia) indicated lethal outcome. However, from then on, clinical condition of the patient improved, inflammatory parameters were declining, urine excretion resumed, and extubation was possible after 6 days of mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, CT scan showed regressive pulmonary infiltrations (Fig. ). Slowly, with significant time delay of 11 days, liver synthesis parameters recovered, and the patient could be moved out from the intensive care unit after 21 days of treatment. At that time point, the LiMAx test demonstrated distinct improvement to 299 μg/h/kg. The following mini-laparoscopy revealed cholestatic changes of liver parenchyma with regenerative nodules and capsular fibrosis (Fig. ). Histopathology of the obtained liver biopsy illustrated advanced connective tissue of the parenchyma in sense of septal fibrosis (F3) accompanied by severe cholestatic liver damage without evidence for precise etiological correlation (Fig. ).\nFinally, the patient could be dismissed from our clinic in markedly ameliorated condition after 38 days. Outpatient three-month follow-up examination showed complete clinical recovery while biochemical parameters were entirely within normal ranges (AST: 21 U/l, ALT: 34 U/l, total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl, INR: 1.07, MELD score: 7). Accordingly, LiMAx illustrated complete restitution of enzymatic liver function with a value of 614 μg/h/kg (normal > 315 μg/h/kg). Figure shows the timespan between events and summarizes the diagnostic/ therapeutic measures that were taken.",Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score,"A 20-year-old male patient was referred to our clinic in December 2017 for acute liver failure (ALF) of unknown origin.

850,Charlson index: 9,cci,9,,"A 65-year old woman, on dialysis for 17 years, told her doctor she was exhausted and that she thought it was because she was taking too many drugs. The patient is an intelligent, independent, acculturated woman who lives alone in the French countryside.\nHer medical history is complex: she was treated with lithium for about 20 years (from age 20 to 40). This was discontinued after she developed CKD; in recent years, under treatment with valproic acid and lamotrigine, her psychophysical balance has been good,.\nShe started smoking when she was 19 years old (30 cigarettes/day) and developed a smoke-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was obese in early adulthood; arterial hypertension was diagnosed at age 30 and type 2 diabetes at age 32, treated using oral hypoglycemic drugs, but she eventually lost about 20 kg, making it possible for antidiabetic drugs to be discontinued. She underwent total thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma at age 41, and started levothyroxine therapy afterwards. Due to a progressive worsening of the kidney function she started hemodialysis at age 50. Her kidney disease was probably multifactorial (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heavy smoking, lithium therapy).\nSeven years after dialysis start, she underwent left hemicolectomy for colon adenocarcinoma, and two years later, left quadrantectomy followed by radiotherapy for ductal mammary adenocarcinoma. She underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy for severe tertiary hyperparathyroidism at age 62. Due to the presence of severe scoliosis, and the development of peripheral neuropathy, she uses painkillers regularly.\nAt the time of the present report, she was on thriceweekly hemodiafiltration, with good dialysis tolerance and high dialysis efficiency (Daugirdas 2 Kt/V: 1.6–1.8).\nHer most recent treatment included antihypertensive drugs (spironolactone 100 mg, amlodipine 20 mg, perindopril 2.5 mg), antipsychotic drugs (valproic acid 600 mg, lamotrigine 100 mg), thyroid hormone (levothyroxine 150 μg), vitamin D, bicarbonate and calcium supplements (calcium carbonate 1 g, sodium bicarbonate 500 mg, vitamin D 25-OH 100,000 UI once a month), potassium and phosphate binders (sodium polystyrene sulphonate, on non-dialysis days and sevelamer 2.4 g per day), darbopoietin 20 μcg once weekly.\nThe clinical examination revealed a woman with good psychophysical balance, a moderate impairment in nutritional status, and a severe comorbidity burden (weight 54 Kg, height 155, BMI: 23 Kg/m2; subjective global assessment: B; malnutrition inflammation index: 10; Charlson index: 9). Apart from signs of chronic bronchitis, and an aortic 2/6 heart bruit, the clinical examination was unremarkable; arterial blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, with mild orthostatic hypotension (135/80 mmHg); heart rate was 68 bpm. The most recent biochemical results are reported in Table .\nThe patient complained of severe fatigue, which had recently increased, and asked her doctor if he thought this could be the result of taking too many drugs.\nIn fact we thought our patient was right about pharmacologic interference, and felt that levothyroxine was the most likely candidate. A biochemical control disclosed a relevant increase in TSH (13.07 mU/L), as compared with her previous routine twice-yearly control (4.14 mU/L).\nIn retrospect, the levothyroxine dose was already high for a woman weighing about 55 Kg, and a reduction in the absorption of levothyroxine should already have been suspected.\nThree of her chronic drugs display potential interference with levothyroxine: calcium carbonate, sevelamer and kayexelate. Since her sevelamer dose had recently been increased from 800 mg once daily to 800 mg 3 times per day, this long-scting phosphate binder was the most likely candidate. In keeping with this hypothesis, one month after discontinuation of sevelamer and modification of the timing of levothyroxine treatment (in the morning after night fasting) TSH was once more in the normal range. In the three months that followed, her levothyroxine dose was reduced to 100 micrograms per day. A further attempt to reintroduce sevelamer, taken at least 6 h after levothyroxine, led to a new increase in TSH (TSH 12.66 mUI/l), once more corrected by discontinuation of sevelamer.\nPubmed and EMBASE were explored (start to February 15th 2018) with the aim of retrieving papers related to dialysis, levothyroxine and phosphate binders. The following terms were employed: (a) dialysis, hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, renal replacement therapy; (b) phosphate binder(s), sevelamer, calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, aluminum hydroxide, lanthanum carbonate; (c) levothyroxine, thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Due to the low number of papers retrieved by this search, a further search was performed combining (b) and (c). The searches, paper selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate (EC and VC); a further search on Google med did not lead to further papers. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third party (GBP). A manual search of the reference lists from identified articles was done to identify additional articles. The search strategy and flow-chart is reported in Fig. .\nGiven the small number of papers retrieved, and their high heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not performed, and the data were narratively discussed, in relation to other sources of information (data obtained in healthy volunteers, or in other diseases).",Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),"A 65-year old woman, on dialysis for 17 years, told her doctor she was exhausted and that she thought it was because she was taking too many drugs.

She reported no previous history of liver test abnormality or liver disease. She was not using any hepatotoxic prescription or over the counter medications or supplements and reported rare consumption of alcohol. Besides, she had no family history of liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, autoimmune disorders or diabetes mellitus.\nThe physical examination was significant for obesity with weight 66 kg, height 146 cm, body mass index (BMI) 31, hepatomegaly, nonpalpable spleen, and lack of stigmata of chronic liver disease. Extensive laboratory workup revealed normal complete blood count, renal function, serum electrolytes, iron studies, serum immunoglobulin levels, and ceruloplasmin. Also, hepatitis B and C serologic tests and autoimmune markers were negative. Fasting lipid profile revealed dyslipidemia (total cholesterol 260 mg/dL, triglycerides 267 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 45 mg/dL, and low density lipoprotein 170 mg/dL). Fasting blood glucose was 165 mg/dL with simultaneous fasting insulin level of 4.8 mill international units/liter and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score of 2.9, thus has insulin resistance.

Magnetic resonance examination defined the liver mass as hemangioma in addition to hepatomegaly and severe hepatic steatosis. Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (sample size of 3.5 cm) showed severe macrosteatosis with mild lobular and periportal inflammation associated with focal hepatocyte damage (Figure , Panel A). Trichrome staining revealed focal portal, periportal and perisinusoidal fibrosis consistent with stage II (Figure , Panel B) with a NASH activity score (NAS) of 7. The patient was instructed to exercise routinely and follow a healthy diet. She was seen in follow-up for three months at which time her weight was unchanged. Physical examination revealed dark brownish red pigment on the teeth, tongue, and oral mucosa. Upon questioning the patient about this finding, she admitted to chewing betel on an average of 10 times per day for the last eight years.

His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3, for diastolic heart failure, age, and history of hypertension, and HAS-BLED score was calculated to be 4, putting him at elevated risk for another serious bleed while on therapeutic anticoagulation. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and transseptal access was performed with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and fluoroscopy guidance. His maximum LAA width measured by echocardiography was 21 mm with maximum depth, 27 mm, measured to the anterior lobe. A 27-mm Watchman device was selected and prepped in the usual fashion and delivered via a dual curve sheath. The activated clotting time during deployment was 213 seconds. As the device was being delivered through the sheath at the area of greatest curvature, the sheath whipped anteriorly before the device exited. Contrast injection during fluoroscopy revealed pericardial staining. Given a presumptive diagnosis of LAA perforation, the device was deployed with sheath remaining in the same distal position given the concern for losing LAA access. After deployment, angiography through the sheath confirmed LAA laceration, with TEE visualization of the device in the transverse sinus (). Given increasing hypotension, 2 pericardial drains were placed with acute evacuation of approximately 1 L of blood. The patient was immediately transfused with packed red blood cells, and anticoagulation was reversed with protamine with the sheath remaining in the atrium. The patient was hemodynamically stabilized but required continuous pericardial drainage despite reversal of anticoagulation. Given the presence of an intact proximal portion of the LAA, the decision was made to deploy the device in the LAA to provide an impediment to blood loss. Following device deployment guided primarily by TEE visualization of the delivery sheath, there was an almost immediate cessation of fluid accumulation in the pericardial space. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and transferred to intensive care unit for further monitoring. The patient was kept sedated and intubated to assure stabilization. On postoperative day (POD) 2, a TEE revealed trace pericardial effusion with adequate device position and no peri-device leak (). The patient was subsequently extubated. A repeat echocardiogram showed only trivial pericardial effusion on POD 4. The patient was maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and colchicine, and he was discharged home on POD 5.

He initially presented with weight loss, worsening cough, and worsening exertional shortness of breath for 3 months prior to presentation. He had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled on insulin. He was an ex-smoker of tobacco with a tobacco smoking history of one pack a day for 10 years but he quit smoking tobacco 20 years ago. He also had a family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in his brother and breast cancer in his niece. He is retired and lives with his wife.\nOn examination, he was afebrile with heart rate of 70 beats/minute and with blood pressure (BP) of 130/80 mmHg. He appeared moderately built and was not in any respiratory distress. His respiratory examination was significant for dullness over the right middle and lower chest on percussion and was associated with reduced breath sounds on auscultation. His cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examinations were non-contributory.\nHis initial computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated a middle lobe mass in his right lung and right lung pleural effusion. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed an increased uptake in the middle lobe mass in his right lung, subcarinal lymph nodes, several bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, and diffuse osseous metastasis. There was no evidence of brain metastasis as evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain. He then had thoracentesis and pleural biopsy with the placement of a pleural catheter. The pleural biopsy was consistent with adenocarcinoma with an acinar pattern. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor cells was positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and negative for CK20. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed evidence of ALK mutation (33% of cells positive for rearrangement). His final diagnosis was stage IV ALK + adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastasis to pleura, mediastinum, and bones. Before the information of ALK positivity was obtained, he was started on combination chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, Alimta (pemetrexed), and Avastin (bevacizumab) of which he successfully completed five cycles. He was followed up regularly in the clinic every 4 weeks. He tolerated the chemotherapy and had a good response with 30% reduction in the lung mass size. He was later started on crizotinib 250 mg twice per day and had a significant response with improved tumor burden in his metastatic sites. He followed up in the clinic every 4 weeks initially for 6 months and then every 8 weeks for 1 year. During his follow-up visits, he remained stable with no evidence of disease progression. He remained on crizotinib for over a year and tolerated it well. During one of the follow-up clinic visits at around 18 months after diagnosis, an MRI scan of his brain was arranged due to a new symptom of headache; it showed numerous brain metastases which was consistent with progression of his disease. A decision was made to stop crizotinib and to start alectinib 600 mg twice daily coupled with cranial radiation.\nWithin 5 weeks of starting alectinib, he developed ARF with his creatinine (Cr) increasing up to 8.16 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to 113 mg/dl. He was anuric at presentation and his laboratory tests were consistent with hyperkalemia and acidosis with a potassium level of 7.1 mEq/L and bicarbonate (HCO3) of < 9 mmol/L. His renal workup revealed BUN/Cr ratio of 13, fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 16%, urine sodium of > 83 mEq/L, and urine osmolality of 334 mOsm/kg. His renal ultrasound did not show any evidence for obstruction (hydronephrosis).

A decision was made to stop crizotinib and to start alectinib 600 mg twice daily coupled with cranial radiation.\nWithin 5 weeks of starting alectinib, he developed ARF with his creatinine (Cr) increasing up to 8.16 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to 113 mg/dl. He was anuric at presentation and his laboratory tests were consistent with hyperkalemia and acidosis with a potassium level of 7.1 mEq/L and bicarbonate (HCO3) of < 9 mmol/L. His renal workup revealed BUN/Cr ratio of 13, urine sodium of > 83 mEq/L, and urine osmolality of 334 mOsm/kg."
3907,Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II of 22 points,apache,22,,"We present the case of a 52-year-old Mexican man who worked as an office employee and lived in a suburban area of the city of Colima, Mexico. He and his wife denied recent trips outside the city. Zoonosis was absent. He was not physically active and did not have an adequate diet. Pathological antecedents revealed liver cirrhosis, diagnosed 12 years ago, alongside esophageal varices that had been treated with sclerotherapy 7 years prior. He also had a diagnosis of essential hypertension, diagnosed 20 years ago. His treatment prior to hospitalization included 20 mg of propranolol every 12 hours, which was used to treat his essential hypertension, esophageal varices, and to reduce his portal hypertension.\nHe arrived at our institution “IMSS General Hospital Zone 1, Colima” in the early afternoon (day 1, see Table ). He began to experience extreme pain localized in his right foot, 16 to 18 hours prior to admission, with a local pain scale of 10/10. He denied any recent forms of punctures to the overlying skin (including animal and insect bites).\nOn physical examination during admission, he was somnolent, oriented in person and space, but not oriented to time. His vital signs were: arterial pressure (AP, systolic/diastolic) 67/49, mean AP (MAP) 55, heart rate (HR) 88, respiratory rate (RR) 16, and body temperature 36 °C. He presented hepatopathy facies and spontaneous eyelid opening, his oral mucosa was dry, and his neck showed jugular engorgement grade I. Both hemithorax were slightly hypoventilated with no adventitious sounds. Precordial was rhythmic with low intensity sounds and no murmurs were heard. Peristalsis was present in his abdomen but low in intensity and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. His upper extremities were symmetrical, eutrophic, with no signs of edema; he moved his upper extremities freely without any limitation, no asterixis was present, and a force scale of 4/5 was seen. During exploration of inferior extremities, there was a clear asymmetric pattern. His right lower extremity was volume augmented with signs of edema ++ including large and small bullae formation with serohematogenous liquid inside involving most of his right foot and ankle (Fig. ). The pedal pulse was present but weak and had a local elevated temperature on palpation. His movements were markedly limited due to extreme pain. Deep vein thrombosis maneuvers were performed and were not present. Plantar reflexes were also not seen.\nA peripheral intravenously administered high-dose double scheme of antibiotics (clindamycin plus ceftriaxone), crystalloid fluids, and corticosteroids was initiated. Laboratory studies were performed soon after admission: hemoglobin (Hb) 12.6 g/dl, hematocrit (Htc) 40.3%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 103.9 fL, white blood cells (WBC) 39,400/mm3, neutrophils 37,460/mm3, platelets 104,000/mm3, thrombin time (TT) 26.7 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.15, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 42.8 seconds, glucose 61 g/dL, urea 102.72 mg/dL, creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TB) 3.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin (DB) 2.6 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 1.5 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 58 U/L, P 7.1 mEq/L, Ca 8.4 mEq/L, Cl 106 mEq/L, K 6.4 mEq/L, Na 129 mEq/L, Mg 1.72 mEq/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 420 U/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.07 mg/L. Correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance was initiated. Deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by clinical assessment and Doppler ultrasound. Aspiration of bulla liquid was obtained and sent to a laboratory for cultivation (positive to Cedecea lapagei, results returned on day 2). Interdisciplinary consultation with angiology was carried out (no indications were added). He was classified with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 11, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II of 22 points (42.4% mortality rate), and a Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score of 11 points (high risk > 75% of having necrotizing fasciitis) [].\nIn the late afternoon (day 1) his somnolence and disorientation persisted, he was hypotensive with an AP of 80/40 with a MAP of 55, and he was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. His hypoglycemia persisted despite vigorous treatment. No fever was present and his skin was pale. His left lower limb had ascending progression of serohematogenous bullae proximal to the patella. His extreme pain continued. Since our patient’s MAP was persistently below 65 mmHg despite intravenously administered fluid therapy, an anterior jugular central venous catheter was placed and we decided to include norepinephrine 8 mg in 0.9% 1000 cc physiological solution passing at a rate of 8 ml/hour, categorizing the case as septic shock []. Concomitantly he had developed acute kidney injury (AKI) “Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes” (KDIGO) stage II.\nDuring the night (day 1), abundant large fetid serohematogenous bullae and edema continued to advance up his right thigh with persistent generalized hypoperfusion. Because of previous mentioned conditions, it was decided to change antibacterial therapy to intravenously administered imipenem and clindamycin. Bullae fluid culture results and antibiogram were not available at that time. Norepinephrine was boosted to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg. Intensive care unit (ICU) was called in for valorization to admit our patient. Unfortunately, due to the lack of space in the ICU, this idea was dismissed. Since rapid deterioration was evident, new laboratory studies were ordered (approximately 10 hours after initial blood test): Hb 10.1 g/dL, Htc 32.7%, MCV 107.5 fL, WBC 11.6/mm3, platelets 35,000/mm3, TT “Does not coagulate”, PTT “Does not coagulate”, glucose 30 g/dL, urea 115.5 mg/dL, creatinine 2.4 mg/dL, K 6.4 mEq/L, Na 130 mEq/L, LDH 406 U/L, and CRP 220 mg/L. His SOFA score was 16.\nNecrotizing fasciitis was our primary diagnosis due to clinical and laboratory findings (LRINEC score of 12 points). Even though the diagnosis was very likely, the lack of a biopsy study meant that we could not confirm such a diagnosis. Multiple organ dysfunction secondary to septic shock was also diagnosed. The differential diagnosis of animal or insect bite was dismissed due to lack of exposure history and lack of puncture wound.\nDuring the next morning (day 2) he maintained the same general conditions. Norepinephrine was boosted up again (MAP 50). Soon after, he entered cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed.

He had not complained of cough, sputum, or myalgia. Beginning 4 days after the initial symptoms, the patient found it difficult to walk, and he was transferred to our hospital.\nThe patient had smoked 10 cigarettes per day from age 18 to 63 years and was diagnosed as having the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He also had a history of resection of lung cancer 2 years before presenting to our hospital. He drinks one glass of beer per day and has never been exposed to dust nor vaccinated for influenza or S pneumoniae infections.\nOn admission, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V4M4 and his vital signs were body temperature 35.1ºC, heart rate 137 bpm, blood pressure 70/30 mmHg, respiratory rate 34/min, and SpO2 78% (under O2 inhalation at 10 L/min). Auscultation did not reveal any murmurs, but the air sounds in his right lung fields were attenuated. Blood gas analysis under O2 inhalation at 10 L/min showed a pH of 7.36, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen of 69.3 Torr, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide of 32.8 Torr, bicarbonate of 18.2 mmol/L, base excess of –6.3 mmol/L, and lactate of 5.75 mmol/L. Peripheral blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 1200/mm3 (neutrophils 86.1%, lymphocytes 10.4%, eosinophils 0%, basophils 0.9%, monocytes 2.6%), hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and platelets of 12.8 × 104/mm3. Serum biochemistry and serology tests were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase 55 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 19 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 213 IU/L, total protein 6.3 g/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL, total bilirubin 4.0 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 27 mg/dL, creatinine 1.11 mg/dL, sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L, C-reactive protein 29.7 mg/dL, procalcitonin 45.91 ng/mL, β-d-glucan <11 pg/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor 2820 U/mL. Rapid urinary antigen test for S pneumoniae was positive, but rapid influenza diagnostic test, urinary antigen test for Legionella sp, and Mycoplasma antigen test using nasopharyngeal swabs were all negative. Sputum and blood culture yielded S pneumoniae. Chest X-ray showed consolidation in the right lung field (Figure A).\nOur patient's CURB-65 score was 5 and we diagnosed him as having severe community-acquired pneumonia and started invasive pulmonary ventilation in the ICU. Cefepime, azithromycin, immunoglobulin, and recombinant thrombomodulin were administered. His blood pressure did not improve by fluid replacement rehydration, and noradrenaline and vasopressin were started but failed. Because he was in septic shock, we initiated polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column hemoperfusion, but he developed anuria. Sputum collected on hospital day (HD) 3 yielded S pneumoniae, but other significant pathogens were not isolated, so we changed antibiotics to penicillin G. Platelets were reduced to 6000/mm3, and his serum ferritin value was elevated to 10 758 ng/mL. Bone marrow aspiration test showed an image of hemophagocytosis (Figure B), and we diagnosed him as having HLH/HPS and started corticosteroid therapy. On HD 6, his blood pressure improved, but his serum bilirubin value had increased by 20.3 mg/dL. Abdominal ultrasound test showed neither an ectatic bile duct nor edematous gallbladder. Anemia progressed to a hemoglobin of 6.7 g/dL, and anuria and hyperbilirubinemia indicated TMA. We checked blood smears and found fragmented red blood cells (RBCs) (Figure C). On the basis of a decrease in ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity to 0.488 (normal range: 0.78-1.57) and serum haptoglobin of <10 mg/dL, we diagnosed him as having TMA. The patient had not developed diarrhea from admission, and plasma exchange was then started. The number of fragmented RBCs (per 1000 RBCs counted) in peripheral blood smears showed zero from HDs 1 and 2, but 30 cells on HD 3, 50 cells on HD 15, 94 cells on HD 17, 42 cells on HD 24, and 24 cells on HD 29. Urine output improved to 400 mL/day on HD 29, and serum bilirubin value recovered to 0.9 mg/dL on HD 39.\nThe patient had developed ventilator-associated pneumonia on HD 9, and we switched antibiotics from penicillin G to cefepime. His respiratory and circulatory conditions improved, and he was extubated on HD 24. However, the patient underwent a tracheotomy the next day because he could not fully expectorate sputum. From HD 29, the patient suffered from pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We administered antibiotics according to antibiotic sensitivity testing, but antibiotic-resistant P aeruginosa was repeatedly isolated, and the patient ultimately died from hospital-acquired pneumonia on HD 43. Paired sera on admission and serum obtained on HD 7 showed a significant increase in antibody titers of influenza B virus (from 10 to 40 titers), and we ultimately diagnosed the patient as having mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia due to influenza virus and S pneumoniae.",CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity,"A 65-year-old man developed dyspnea on effort and general fatigue in March 2018, followed 3 days later by a fever of 38ºC and appetite loss.

6875,Corrected calcium was raised at 3.82 mmol/L.,corrected_calcium,3.82,mg/dL,"A 35-year-old woman presented to the Royal United Hospital in Bath (United Kingdom) Emergency Department in October 2017 with a three-day history of new onset epigastric pain radiating to the back, associated with vomiting and reduced nutritional intake over several weeks. She had a history of alcohol excess, but her family confirmed she had been abstinent for 3 months before admission. Her medical history included anxiety and depression, which were untreated at the time – her selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor had been stopped several weeks earlier. She also reported chronic back pain, for which she self-medicated using over-the-counter analgesia. She denied ever discussing her self-medication with a health care professional. She had no known gallstone disease and was taking no prescription medications at the time. No further relevant medical, family, or social history was recorded. On examination, she was tachycardic and her abdomen was very tender across the epigastrium.\nDuring the admission clerking, she reported longstanding excessive self-medication with oral antacids and over the counter analgesia. She reported consuming up to 72 calcium carbonate with heavy magnesium carbonate tablets (Rennie Peppermint, Bayer plc, Reading, United Kingdom) per day and 600 mL of sodium alginate with sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate liquid (Gaviscon Original Aniseed Relief, Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare Limited, Hull, United Kingdom) per week over the past 8 months to tackle reflux symptoms. Both these medications are rich in calcium (,). She also reported taking up to 6 g of ibuprofen and 7.5 g of paracetamol per day for her back pain – respectively 2.5 and 1.9 times the maximum recommended daily doses for adults according to the British National Formulary ().\nAdmission blood tests showed raised white cells (19.2 × 109/L), C-reactive protein (118 mg/L), and amylase (2121 U/L). Corrected calcium was raised at 3.82 mmol/L. Venous blood gas highlighted a metabolic alkalosis, with pH 7.451 and raised base excess (+3.8 mEq) and bicarbonate (28.1 mEq/L). Deranged liver function and clotting were also found. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen detected no gallstones. Due to raised calcium, she was treated for hypercalcemic acute pancreatitis secondary to excessive antacid administration (Modified Glasgow Score: 2). This was described as acute pancreatitis secondary to milk-alkali syndrome with preserved renal function (). She underwent aggressive intravenous and oral fluid resuscitation to lower calcium and replace electrolytes. She also received N-acetylcysteine for accidental paracetamol overdose, and vitamin K for deranged clotting. Her adjusted calcium dropped steadily throughout hospitalization, reaching its trough on day 6 (1.70 mmol/L) and resulting in severe rebound hypocalcemia. This was attributable to sudden discontinuation of antacids and calcium sequestration due to acute pancreatitis (). Oral and intravenous replacement restored normal calcium levels (adjusted calcium 2.29 mmol/L on discharge on day 10).\nIn addition, on day 2 after admission her hemoglobin dropped significantly (90 g/L to 65 g/L). Due to the history of excessive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, urgent gastroscopy was carried out to exclude peptic ulcer bleeding. Two non-bleeding 10 mm gastric ulcers were found at the incisura and pylorus. Rapid urease test was negative, associating the ulcers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastric irritation. Her drug chart showed that she had received over 5.5 L of intravenous fluids in 24 hours, before the hemoglobin drop. The hemoglobin drop was attributed to hemodilution – this recovered steadily after 2 units of packed red blood cells. High dose proton pump inhibitor was also commenced to treat the ulcers.\nTen days post-admission, her electrolytes normalized, inflammatory markers improved, and pancreatitis symptoms resolved. She received counselling regarding excessive self-medication and reported to understand its serious consequences at the time. She was advised to seek further support in relation to her self-medication and mood, and follow-up was arranged to see community mental health services. The patient was discharged home with gastroenterology follow-up. Six months later she remained asymptomatic, with normal electrolytes and no further evidence of excessive self-medication.

In addition to dyspnea, she reported right lower extremity swelling and pain, which started 4 days prior to this presentation. The patient denied chest pain, palpitations, recent weight loss, known history of personal or family history of blood clots, history of miscarriages, and recent travel. Her only medication was oral contraceptive pill for menorrhagia.\nShe was hypoxic requiring 2 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation >90%, with respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. She was mildly tachycardic with a heart rate of 108 bpm and blood pressure was 144/90, and the temperature was 36.6°C. The physical examination was significant for morbid obesity and right lower extremity swelling without sings of phlegmasia cerulea dolens. Troponin I level was normal, BNP was elevated at 704 pg/ml (reference 0-100 pg/ml), 12 lead ECG showed sinus rhythm 95 bpm with S1Q3T3 pattern (): Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Wells' score was 7.5 (3 points for clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, 3 points of PE being the most likely diagnosis, and 1.5 points for heart rate > 100 bpm) rendering high chance of PE; therefore, CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed (). It demonstrated saddle type pulmonary embolus with extension into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches in the bilateral upper and bilateral lower lobes along with right ventricular (RV) strain (RV end-diastolic diameter was increased with RV to left ventricular (LV) diameter ratio >1) and mild dilatation of main pulmonary artery (35mm, normal is < 29 mm) [–]. CTPA also showed a linear band of low density extending within the left atrium and into the left ventricle most compatible with thrombus.\nThe patient was started on unfractionated heparin infusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed to further assess the intracardiac clot burden, the RV strain and to identify right-to-left shunt. TTE () showed a large mobile mass straddling the interatrial septum with elements in both atria, extending to and past the mitral valve and prolapsing into the left ventricle during diastole. This was highly suggestive of a communication between the atria consistent with large patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. Moderately dilated RV (RV/LV diameter ratio >1) with severely impaired RV systolic function, moderate RA dilation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 73 mmHg and systolic flattening of the interventricular septum were also noted. All these findings were consistent with RV strain caused by PE. Lower extremity venous doppler ultrasound showed unstable occlusive extensive thrombus within the right femoral vein extending through the right popliteal vein.\nBecause of large clot burden as well as impending paradoxical embolization, the patient underwent emergent open pulmonary embolectomy, removal of right and left atrial thrombi, and PFO closure (). Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the TTE findings (): because of the presence of an unstable extensive lower extremity venous thrombus an inferior vena cava filter was also placed. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was discharged from the hospital on oral anticoagulation with warfarin. Six month later during her follow-up visit repeat TTE demonstrated improvement in RV dilation, TV regurgitation, and PA pressure (PA systolic pressure was reduced to 26 mmHg).",Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,"A 39-year-old female with history of asthma, obesity, and menorrhagia presented to the hospital with one-week history of exertional shortness of breath.

In his medical history, his birth weight was 3.06 kg with no family first degree relative with history of Diabetes. We decided to initiate insulin treatment (12 units/day of Levemir and 01unit of pre-prandial lispro) with good clinical response. The patient did not demonstrate hypoglycemia during this period. Both situations suggested the diagnostic of type 1 diabetes and the probability that he was on a spontaneous period of partial clinical remission (honeymoon phase) [, ]. In the follow-up period over the next 6 months, the insulin requirement did not change, and he maintained good glucose control levels (Fig. a). Hb A1c control was 6.3%.\nThe low insulin-dose requirement in a long time and his non-acute presentation, in the childhood, of diabetes was unusual for type 1 diabetes. We decide to request an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with measure of Glucose (mg / dl), insulin (uUI/ml) and C-peptide (ng/ml) to evaluate pancreatic response. The following results for the test we see in the Fig. .\nThese results were not typical of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and supported further evaluation. In addition, we performed an OGTT on his parents, with normal results. We considered appropriate to perform a test for diagnosis of MODY. MODY panel was performed in the next follow up, by next generation sequencing identifying a pathogenic variant c.629C>T p.(Thr210Met). in heterozygous in GCK gene confirmed by Sanger sequencing according to the American College of Medical Genetics (Fig. ). However, this variant has been previously described as associated with MODY diabetes [, ]. The biochemical studies show this variant causes the reduction of GCK enzyme activity. This result confirmed the diagnosis of GCK-MODY. The specific molecular analysis for GCK also was performed in his parents. The result was negative for this variant, which suggested that it was a “de novo” variant.\nWith the result of genetic analysis, we suspended insulin. We decided to initiate metformin (850 mg) twice/day. The clinical response was excellent as well as the initial treatment (Fig. b). We also suggested life-style change with nutritional follow-up.\nIn the follow-up period to asses control, continuous glucose monitoring was performed to evaluate glucose levels. We see the initial response to insulin treatment during this period in Fig. a. A second report of continuous glucose monitoring was performed during oral medication treatment (Fig. b). Currently, the patient continues with only oral medication (metformin), and he increased his weigh with optimal clinical control. His most recent Hb A1c was 6.2%.",Calculated LDL,"A 15 years old male diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was referred to an endocrinology outpatient clinic. He was diagnostic at age 13 with an A1c control in 6.8% and initiated treatment with metformin twice a day. After two years of irregular follow up, the patient presented with history of 2 kg weight loss, fatigue, mild polydipsia and polyuria but without signs of insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans and/ or obesity. His weight was 52 kg (BMI between the 10th and 25th percentiles for age and gender), Hb: 14.6 g/dL, fasting glucose: 132 mg/dl, Hb A1c: 6.4%, creatinine clearance: 181.61 ml/min, C-peptide: 1.63 nmol/L, total cholesterol:166, Triglycerides: 64 mg/dl and HDL: 39 mg/dl.

26258,Preoperative CT scan showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the inferior pole of the right kidney suggestive of neoplastic lesion (PADUA score 8),padua,8,,"A 41-year-old male presented with a coincidental right renal mass. He gave a history suggestive of chronic prostatitis and had mild urinary frequency and occasional mild urgency. He also had a history of previous open appendectomy. Preoperative CT scan showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the inferior pole of the right kidney suggestive of neoplastic lesion (PADUA score 8) () for which he underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with 25 minutes warm ischemia time and the surgery was uneventful. During surgery, the right colon was reflected medially, followed by dissection of the renal hilum, and identification of the artery and vein. The tumor was identified and the resection margins were identified and marked with cautery. After clamping the renal artery, the tumor was resected with an approximately 3-5 mm rim of normal renal parenchyma. We could not identify any urinary leak and the resection bed was sutured using polyglactin in a running fashion. The renal capsule was approximated over a small piece of Surgicel using polyglactin as well. Histopathology demonstrated a 2.9 × 3.8 × 3.4 cm Fuhrman grade II clear cell carcinoma which was confined to the capsule (T1a N0 M0).\nPostoperatively, he did well and the drain was removed after 48 hours as it was bringing only 45 cc of serosanguinous fluid as suggested by potassium and creatinine levels, which were similar to the serum values. One day later, he developed high-grade fever, and CT scan showed minimal urine leak from the site of the partial nephrectomy (). He refused nephrostomy tube insertion, so he underwent cystoscopy and JJ stent insertion on the 6th postop day. During the procedure, retrograde pyelography showed no abnormality in the upper ureter or kidney apart from the leak from the site of surgery. Therefore, 26 cm, 6 FR stent was inserted easily () and a Foley's catheter was fixed. The patient was discharged on the eighth postop day.\nThree days postdischarge, he presented with severe bladder spasms and insisted on catheter removal which was reinserted 24 hours later. He then developed fever with minimal abdominal pain for which he was admitted on the 9th postdischarge day. CT scan showed extravasation of urine at the site of the previous surgery with fluid collection (3.8 × 1.8 cm) associated with few gas bubble and mild right pleural reaction. He was offered a nephrostomy tube but he totally refused again, so he was convinced to have a perirenal drain, which was inserted in the presence of the JJ stent and urethral catheter. Subsequently, he continued to have severe bladder spasms despite the antimuscarinic agents. Indeed, he tried several times to pull the catheter which got blocked and all the urine from both kidneys was coming out from the perirenal drain. In view of this and the agony that he had, we decided to remove the JJ stent and urethral catheter and leave only the perirenal drain.\nSubsequently, almost half of urine output was coming out from the perirenal drain. Another CT scan showed the pigtail drain tube to be adjacent to the site of partial nephrectomy and no contrast was going down the ureter. So, the drain was pulled out 2 cm under CT guidance. CT scan then showed free drainage of urine along the ureter. The drain was left in place for two days during which it did not drain any urine. The patient felt well with no fever, so the drain was removed three days later. During all this time, the kidney did not show any significant dilation on either ultrasound or CT scan.\nPostdischarge, he did well initially, but in few days, he started to develop urinary tract infections that were occasionally associated with low-grade fever but no abdominal pain. Ultrasound again did not show any abnormality. One month later, he was readmitted with high-grade fever. CT scan showed an ongoing leak which was, this time, more medial with minimal dilation of the collecting system. A trial to insert a JJ stent failed and retrograde pyelography showed normal ureter up to approximately 3 cm below the ureteropelvic junction which had a blind end and there was a fistula between the upper ureter and lower calyceal system (ureterocalyceal fistula) (Figures and ). Using an ureteroscope, a trial to negotiate the way to the UPJ was not successful. A nephrostomy tube was inserted and a trial to pass a JJ stent and guidewire, antegradely, also failed. Six weeks later, he had another trial to pass the stent antegradely which also failed. He then underwent an open surgical exploration through an anterior midline incision. A trial to bridge the gap between the upper ureter and renal pelvis failed due to the intrarenal nature of the pelvis and the severe adhesion, and indeed, there was a small injury of the IVC during dissection. So, with huge difficulty, a ureterocalyceal anastomosis was finally performed to another calyx (one of the anterior calyces) despite the nondilated nature of the calyces, previous surgery in the area, and the reasonably thick renal parenchyma as he totally refused the idea of nephrectomy. This required resection of a small wedge of renal tissues to prevent future anastomotic stenosis. Postoperatively, he did well and was discharged on the 7th postoperative day.",Padua Prediction Score for Risk of VTE,A 41-year-old male presented with a coincidental right renal mass.

CT head revealed areas of acute infarct seen involving the brain stem as well as the cerebellar hemispheres and moderate enlargement of the ventricular system with left-sided intraventricular hemorrhage (Figures and ). Due to the acute nature of her abdomen and the concern for a seeded VP shunt from this intra-abdominal infection, neurosurgery was consulted. The patient subsequently underwent externalization of her VP shunt at the neck. Concurrently, general surgery was consulted who decided to perform an explorative laparotomy for her acute abdomen. Preoperative records showed that her mean arterial blood pressure was ranging from 60 to 65 mmHg, heart rate was ranging from 70 to 82 normal sinus rhythm, the temperature was 98.4 F, and oxygen saturation was 96-98 on room air. Her preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST-T wave changes ().

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for preoperative risk was 3 points (class IV risk) based on the proposed intraperitoneal surgery, cerebrovascular disease, and preoperative treatment with insulin. Due to the emergent nature of the required surgery, an extensive discussion was done with the patient's next of kin who agreed to proceed with the surgery. The patient was well monitored intraoperatively in the standard manner under the direct supervision of the attending anesthesiologist. Intraoperatively, the patient suddenly started becoming bradycardic and went into asystole. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitative (CPR) efforts were initiated as per the standard advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) algorithm. High-quality chest compressions and epinephrine injection were administered every 3 minutes. Appropriate rhythm checks in between the chest compression were done. The patient already had an advanced airway in place for surgery. There were appropriate peripheral intravenous lines, triple lumen central venous catheter, and arterial line that was placed preoperatively for access and hemodynamic monitoring. The patient did not have a shockable rhythm throughout the cardiac arrest. After 30 minutes of CPR, the patient did not have any signs of the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Thus, the patient was pronounced dead and all resuscitation efforts were ceased. The abdominal cavity was closed. The patient was disconnected from the ventilator with a plan to move to the mortuary.

On postoperative day 4, the patient was transferred to a regular room on the 2 L nasal cannula. Considering the patient's poor prognosis, the patient was provided comfort care and died on postoperative day 7.",Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,"A 33-year-old Hispanic, blind, and aphasic female with a history of diabetes mellitus on insulin at home, craniotomy for meningioma status post ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement, presented to the hospital with a one-day history of drowsiness and emesis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed several loops of small bowel in the right side of the abdomen with thickening immediately adjacent to the VP shunt concerning for inflammation of the bowel (). CT head revealed areas of acute infarct seen involving the brain stem as well as the cerebellar hemispheres and moderate enlargement of the ventricular system with left-sided intraventricular hemorrhage (Figures and ). Due to the acute nature of her abdomen and the concern for a seeded VP shunt from this intra-abdominal infection, neurosurgery was consulted. The patient subsequently underwent externalization of her VP shunt at the neck. Concurrently, general surgery was consulted who decided to perform an explorative laparotomy for her acute abdomen. Preoperative records showed that her mean arterial blood pressure was ranging from 60 to 65 mmHg, heart rate was ranging from 70 to 82 normal sinus rhythm, the temperature was 98.4 F, and oxygen saturation was 96-98 on room air. Her preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST-T wave changes (). Her preoperative laboratory values were as follows: white blood cell count 5300 per microliter of blood, hemoglobin 8.2 grams/deciliter, platelet 98000 per microliter of blood, prothrombin time 16.1 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.2, serum sodium 148 meq/liter, serum potassium 3.7 meq/liter, chloride 112 meq/liter, BUN 17 mg/deciliter, creatinine 0.4 mg/deciliter, serum glucose 125 mg/deciliter, serum calcium 8.2 mg/deciliter, magnesium 2.4 gm/deciliter, aspartate transaminase 32 units per liter, and alanine transaminase 43 units per liter. The patient was deemed to be at high risk for the major cardiac event after the surgery defined as death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest within 30 days after noncardiac surgery."

She had a psychiatric history of mild innate anxiety but was not medicated. She was prescribed subcutaneous injection of PEG-IFNα-2a at a dose of 180 μg per week to treat chronic hepatitis. After initiation of therapy, a low-grade fever and mild general fatigue were observed. Psychiatric symptoms such as enervation, palpitations, an episode of hyperventilation, and consciousness disturbances with myotonia appeared after the third injection of PEG-IFNα-2a. It was impossible to decide if the symptoms were IFN-related or due to a somatization disorder elicited by anxiety, but the IFN therapy was discontinued and followed by administration of etizolam and paroxetine hydrochloride hydrate treatment by psychiatrists. Although the symptoms gradually improved, it took 3 months for the patient to completely recover (Fig. ); the anti-anxiety medications were continued for a prolonged period. While waiting for approval of DAA therapy, the patient was administered liver supporting therapies: oral ursodeoxycholic acid and glycyrrhizinate. Upon approval, the patient was administrated with IFN-free sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination therapy. She was 57 years at this time point and 8 years had elapsed since the PEG-IFN therapy. The patient remained diagnosed with chronic hepatitis, as she showed a low score of 2.50 in the fibrosis-4 index [] and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index [] was 0.731. Unexpectedly, psychiatric symptoms similar to those observed with IFN and consciousness disturbance attacks appeared 4 days after treatment initiation. Initially, psychiatrists attributed the symptoms to epileptic seizures, and sodium valproate was administrated. However, her symptoms did not improve, and the patient was admitted for further observation and treatment.\nPhysical examination was unremarkable. The liver and spleen were not palpable, and her bowel sounds were normal. Anemia and jaundice were not seen in palpebral conjunctiva or bulbar conjunctiva. Flapping tremor and leg edema were absent. Abnormal neurological finding were not detected. The patient denied alcohol and/or drug abuse. Upon admission, the patient was administrated etizolam and paroxetine for anxiety disorder, ursodeoxycholic acid and glycyrrhizinate for chronic hepatitis, and metoprolol and enalapril for chronic heart failure after a surgical operation for endocardial cushion defect. Other than a mild increase in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels due to sodium valproate administration, no abnormal laboratory findings, including ammonium or glycemic levels that might induce consciousness disturbances, were found (Table ). There was no evidence for HBV and HIV co-infection. Furthermore, the patient’s electroencephalogram and brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were normal (Fig. a-c). These results indicated no evidence of infection or hepatic or drug-induced encephalopathy. In addition, the patient had stable vital signs and communicated well even during the psychiatric attacks unless prompted about hepatitis related topics (which would not have been the case if she was suffering from epileptic seizures). Based on the clinical picture, psychiatrists confirmed a diagnosis of somatization disorder induced by anxiety from antiviral therapy. Sodium valproate, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin were discontinued, and her symptoms gradually disappeared after 3 months. Anti-anxiety medication was continued for treatment of the somatization disorder; the patient continued to receive liver supporting therapies because of a mild increase in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels; interruption of antiviral therapy showed no clearance of HCV.

Thus, even in an apparently healthy patient, age continues to be a very important risk factor. Although clinical trial data are scarce for primary prevention in subjects of this age, on the basis of risk, the NCEP ATP III update recommends an optional LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL for this patient []. If the patient were hypertensive, this recommendation would be supported by the findings of the ASCOT-LLA []. In that study, patients had a mean baseline LDL-C just over 130 mg/dL; treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/d versus placebo led to a significant reduction in CV risk, and this effect remained apparent in patients aged over 65 years []. Likewise, were the patient to have an elevated CRP, the results of the JUPITER [] trial would have some bearing on his treatment. However, there have been no specific trials addressing patients of this type. Thus, in the absence of new recommendations, current guidelines should be followed and the patient should be treated to an LDL-C goal of <130 mg/dL or an optional goal of 100 mg/dL with an appropriate statin, titrated to goal. To reach the optional goal, it would be necessary to use a statin regimen that would allow at least a 29% reduction in LDL-C (). Consequently, a variety of options are available, including the use of generic statins.",Framingham Risk Score,"This 80-year-old Caucasian male continues to be an avid mountain climber and comes in for a medical evaluation prior to his next climb.
